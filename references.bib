  abstract = {In some coastal cities there is an urgent need to decide on adaptation investments given the long periods needed to complete the relevant infrastructures. However such decisions are usually made under significant uncertainty due to local climate change and socio-economic impacts. The Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) has developed four global scenarios according to different representative concentration pathways (RCPs); however, using these scenarios directly is equivalent to using incomplete information in the decision-making process because they do not provide information on what sea level rise behavior is most probable. In this study, I propose a model which assigns probabilities to IPCC scenarios with Local Sea Level Rise (LSLR) information. I obtain expected damage and risk measures for the world's 120 major coastal mega-cities at specific moments in time. That is, I consider uncertainty in both scenario selection and within each scenario. With this information it is possible to make adaptation investment decisions under uncertainty with a criterion of not exceeding certain risk levels in the future. The paper shows that in the year 2100 for the equal probability mixed scenario (25\% RCP 2.6, 50\% RCP 4.5 and 25 RCP 8.5) the expected damage is US\$ 1,251,732 millions for New Orleans and US\$ 1,196,517 millions for Guangzhou. The risk measurements show that in that year the damage in the 5\% of worse cases will be US\$ 2,800,756 millions for Guangzhou and US\$ 1,832,466 millions for New Orleans. However, not all countries have sufficient resources to make the necessary adaptation investments, so we analyze expected damage and risk according to World Bank country income groups. The paper shows that the USA and China will need to make major adaptation investments in the future. The coastal LSLR risk in lower-income cities is also calculated.}

Researchers have started to evaluate the costs and benefits of flood adaptation, but information regarding the cost of different flood adaptation measures is often not available or is hidden in non-peer-reviewed literature. Recent review studies have explored cost estimates for different aspects of flood adaptation, such as nature-based solutions. This study aims to contribute empirical data regarding the cost of flood adaptation by compiling peer-reviewed literature and research reports. The focus is on construction costs and expenses for operation and maintenance. This paper integrates the unit cost information of six main flood adaptation measure categories: (1) the flood-proofing of buildings, (2) flood protection, (3) beach nourishment and dunes, (4) nature-based solutions for coastal ecosystems, (5) channel management and nature-based solutions for riverine systems, and (6) urban drainage. Cost estimates are corrected for inflation and converted to U.S. dollars (2016). Measures are described, and cost figures for both developed and developing countries are provided. The results of this study can be used as input for economic-assessment studies on flood adaptation measures.},

  abstract = {The devastating impact by Hurricane Sandy (2012) again showed New York City (NYC) is one of the most vulnerable cities to coastal flooding around the globe. The low-lying areas in NYC can be flooded by nor'easter storms and North Atlantic hurricanes. The few studies that have estimated potential flood damage for NYC base their damage estimates on only a single, or a few, possible flood events. The objective of this study is to assess the full distribution of hurricane flood risk in NYC. This is done by calculating potential flood damage with a flood damage model that uses many possible storms and surge heights as input. These storms are representative for the low-probability/high-impact flood hazard faced by the city. Exceedance probability-loss curves are constructed under different assumptions about the severity of flood damage. The estimated flood damage to buildings for NYC is between US\$59 and 129 millions/year. The damage caused by a 1/100-year storm surge is within a range of US\$2 bn\textendash 5 bn, while this is between US\$5 bn and 11 bn for a 1/500-year storm surge. An analysis of flood risk in each of the five boroughs of NYC finds that Brooklyn and Queens are the most vulnerable to flooding. This study examines several uncertainties in the various steps of the risk analysis, which resulted in variations in flood damage estimations. These uncertainties include: the interpolation of flood depths; the use of different flood damage curves; and the influence of the spectra of characteristics of the simulated hurricanes.},

Such multidisciplinary approaches can inform flood-risk management policy development.}

Such empirical assessments can provide an additional measure of the resilience of power plants going forward. Here I analyse climate-linked outages in nuclear power plants over the past three decades. My assessment shows that the average frequency of climate-induced disruptions has dramatically increased from 0.2 outage per reactor-year in the 1990s to 1.5 in the past decade. Based on the projections for adopted climate scenarios, the average annual energy loss of the global nuclear fleet is estimated to range between 0.8\% and 1.4\% in the mid-term (2046\textendash 2065) and 1.4\% and 2.4\% in the long term (2081\textendash 2100).},

  abstract = {Groundwater is a vital source of freshwater, supporting the livelihood of over two billion people worldwide. The quantitative assessment of groundwater resources is critical for sustainable management of this strained resource, particularly as climate warming, population growth, and socioeconomic development further press the water resources. Rapid growth in the availability of a plethora of in-situ and remotely sensed data alongside advancements in data-driven methods and machine learning offer immense opportunities for an improved assessment of groundwater resources at the local to global levels. This systematic review documents the advancements in this field and evaluates the accuracy of various models, following the protocol developed by the Center for Evidence-Based Conservation. A total of 197 original peer-reviewed articles from 2010\textendash 2020 and from 28 countries that employ regression machine learning algorithms for groundwater monitoring or prediction are analyzed and their results are aggregated through a meta-analysis. Our analysis points to the capability of machine learning models to monitor/predict different characteristics of groundwater resources effectively and efficiently. Modeling the groundwater level is the most popular application of machine learning models, and the groundwater level in previous time steps is the most employed input data. The feed-forward artificial neural network is the most employed and accurate model, although the model performance does not exhibit a striking dependence on the model choice, but rather the information content of the input variables. Around 10\textendash 12 years of data are required to develop an acceptable machine learning model with a monthly temporal resolution. Finally, advances in machine and deep learning algorithms and computational advancements to merge them with physics-based models offer unprecedented opportunities to employ new information, e.g., InSAR data, for increased spatiotemporal resolution and accuracy of groundwater monitoring and prediction.},

System Dynamic simulation involves several steps, including system conceptualization, data collection, simulation model development, and model verification and sensitivity analysis. A high-level conceptualization of the El Paso water resources system is presented, including withdrawal sources, water and wastewater treatment facilities, water demands, and flow linkages are will be presented. The conceptual model provides the basis for quantitative stock-and-flow model, which is developed under development using data inputs and data from water local management agencies. The modeling process facilitates understanding of potential vulnerabilities to of the system and likely causes of failure, thereby offering a useful platform for water resources planning and management at the strategic level.},

  abstract = {Strengthened land-atmosphere coupling in the northeastern United States (NEUS), accompanied by a positive soil moisture-rainfall feedback, may lead to more drought. Coupling between the land and atmosphere emerges when low soil moisture values limit surface latent heat flux, or evapotranspiration, so that a majority of absorbed solar radiation is emitted from the surface as sensible heat. In this study, the Weather Research and Forecasting model was run with four prescribed soil moisture levels across 7 years to elucidate the strength of land-atmosphere coupling under potential, future soil moisture states in the NEUS. Under drier conditions, land-atmosphere coupling strengthens, and a positive soil moisture-precipitation feedback develops in all years despite differences in the amount of moisture advected into the study domain. As snowpack decreases and evaporative demand increases, soil conditions may become drier in future summers over the NEUS, resulting in the more frequent development of drought.}

  abstract = {Accurate forecasting of peak electricity load has long been an active area of research in electricity markets, and power systems planning and operation. Unanticipated climate-induced surges in peak load can lead to supply shortages causing frequent brownouts and blackouts, and large-scale socioeconomic impacts. In this paper, the climate sensitivity of daily peak load is characterized by leveraging advanced statistical machine learning algorithms. More specifically, a rigorously tested and validated predictive model based on the Bayesian additive regression trees algorithm is proposed. Results from this study revealed that maximum daily temperature followed by mean dew point temperature are the most important predictors of the climate-sensitive portion of daily peak load. Among the non-climatic predictors, electricity price was found to have a strong positive association with the daily peak load. Economic growth was observed to have an inverse association with the daily peak load. While the proposed framework is established for the state of Texas, one of the most energy-intensive states with geographic and demographic susceptibility to climatic change, the methodology can be extended to other states/regions. The model can also be used to make short-term predictions of the climate-sensitive portion of daily peak load.}

  abstract = {Ensuring safe water supply for communities across the United States is a growing challenge in the face of aging infrastructure, impaired source water, and strained community finances. In the aftermath of the Flint lead crisis, there is an urgent need to assess the current state of US drinking water. However, no nationwide assessment has yet been conducted on trends in drinking water quality violations across several decades. Efforts to reduce violations are of national concern given that, in 2015, nearly 21 million people relied on community water systems that violated health-based quality standards. In this paper, we evaluate spatial and temporal patterns in health-related violations of the Safe Drinking Water Act using a panel dataset of 17,900 community water systems over the period 1982\textendash 2015. We also identify vulnerability factors of communities and water systems through probit regression. Increasing time trends and violation hot spots are detected in several states, particularly in the Southwest region. Repeat violations are prevalent in locations of violation hot spots, indicating that water systems in these regions struggle with recurring issues. In terms of vulnerability factors, we find that violation incidence in rural areas is substantially higher than in urbanized areas. Meanwhile, private ownership and purchased water source are associated with compliance. These findings indicate the types of underperforming systems that might benefit from assistance in achieving consistent compliance. We discuss why certain violations might be clustered in some regions and strategies for improving national drinking water quality.},

Also, performance-based regulation, accompanied by quality regulation, increases the need to understand and quantify differences in reliability performance between networks. Distribution system reliability performance indices exhibit stochastic behavior due to the impact of severe weather. In this paper, a new reliability model is presented which incorporates the stochastic nature of the severe weather intensity and duration to model variations in failure rate and restoration time. The model considers the impact of high winds and lightning and can be expanded to account for more types of severe weather. Furthermore, the modeling approach considers when severe weather is likely to occur during the year by using a nonhomogeneous Poisson process (NHPP). The proposed model is validated and applied to a test system to estimate reliability indices. Results show that the stochasticity in weather has a great impact on the variance in the reliability indices. \textcopyright{} 2010 IEEE.}

A key question is how climate variability and change will affect peak heating and cooling demand in an electrified future. We conduct a spatially explicit analysis of trends in temperature-based proxies of electricity demand over the past 70 years. Average annual demand for heating (cooling) decreases (increases) over most of the contiguous US. However, while climate change drives robust increases in peak cooling demand, trends in peak heating demand are generally smaller and less robust. Because the distribution of temperature exhibits a long left tail, severe cold snaps dominate the extremes of thermal demand. As building heating electrifies, system operators must account for these events to ensure reliability.},

  abstract = {Developing effective governance structures for the fair and sustainable use of benefits that flow from shared natural resources is arguably one of the defining challenges of our time. Addressing this challenge has been extremely difficult because the associated governance problem is multifaceted and multilayered. Governance structures must address at least three interrelated issues: ( i ) equitable distribution within and across generations of affordances for well-being; ( ii ) social dilemmas associated with providing shared infrastructure and preventing overexploitation of shared resources; and ( iii ) coping with deep uncertainty and variability that complicates decision-making and planning efforts. Addressing these issues will often require us, both as individuals and in groups, to act against our natural tendencies. Familiar examples related to the first two issues include delaying rewards for the sake of future outcomes and overcoming our aversion to the ``sucker's pay-off'' to build sufficient trust to address social dilemmas. Recent work suggests that this is also true when coping with uncertainty and variability in benefit flows while sustaining them over the long term. Specifically, Carpenter et al. (1) develop an important set of ideas related to managing environmental variability that may cause two of our natural aversions to collide. The authors suggest that we must learn to live with a certain amount of variability if we want to enlarge the safe operating space for exploited ecosystems. Just as with delayed rewards, humans are averse to variability in benefit flows related to subsistence (2, 3). More challenging yet, because allowing variability in ecosystems may well involve reduced exploitation, we may be required to forego present consumption as well as tolerate variability to maintain a safe operating space for humanity. Of these challenges, coping with uncertainty and variation in benefit flows is the most difficult to conceptualize. Although all three are difficult to address in practice, \ldots{}  [{$\carriagereturn$}][1]1Email: m.anderies\{at\}asu.edu.  [1]: \#xref-corresp-1-1},

This article explores the use of the robust control framework toward this end. After briefly outlining the robust control framework, we apply it to the traditional Gordon\textendash Schaefer fishery model to explore fundamental performance\textendash robustness and robustness\textendash vulnerability trade-offs in natural resource management. We find that the classic optimal control policy can be very sensitive to parametric uncertainty. By exploring a large class of alternative strategies, we show that there are no panaceas: even mild robustness properties are difficult to achieve, and increasing robustness to some parameters (e.g., biological parameters) results in decreased robustness with respect to others (e.g., economic parameters). On the basis of this example, we extract some broader themes for better management of resources under uncertainty and for sustainability science in general. Specifically, we focus attention on the importance of a continual learning process and the use of robust control to inform this process.},

  abstract = {Recent increase in the number of natural disasters resulting in widespread, long-duration, and costly outages have brought the energy system resilience to the forefront. As system owners and operators seek to improve the system resilience, they often find it challenging to assess the costs and benefits of resilience investments. Costs are fairly well understood and measured, but benefits are less so. There are many resilience metrics that attempt to measure resilience benefit, but the existing methods for calculating metrics and incorporating value of resilience in energy decisions are not easily executed. To address this, we developed a method for modeling the value of resilience that is flexible and scalable across multiple types of models. This article describes a framework for incorporating duration-dependent customer damage functions (CDFs) into grid- and campus-scale planning and operations models. In two case studies, we consider how the duration-dependent value of resilience influences the investment and operation decisions. We find that in both cases, knowledge of the value of lost load provides opportunities to reduce the lifecycle cost of energy through adjusted investment or operational decisions. The primary contribution of this research is to integrate the duration-dependent value of resilience in energy decisions. This study will be useful to grid operators interested in reducing the value of customer losses during grid outages, as well as campus or site owners evaluating resilience investments.}

  abstract = {The ability to predict coastal flooding events and associated impacts has emerged as a primary societal need within the context of projected sea level rise (SLR) and climate change. The duration and extent of flooding is the result of nonlinear interactions between multiple environmental forcings (oceanographic, meteorological, hydrological) acting at varying spatial (local to global) and temporal scales (hours to centuries). Individual components contributing to total water levels (TWLs) include astronomical tides, monthly sea level anomalies, storm surges, and wave setup. Common practices often use the observational record of extreme water levels to estimate return levels of future extremes. However, such projections often do not account for the individual contribution of processes resulting in compound TWL events, nor do they account for time-dependent probabilities due to seasonal, interannual, and long-term oscillations within the climate system. More robust estimates of coastal flooding risk require the computation of joint probabilities and the simulation of hypothetical TWLs to better constrain the projection of extremes (Serafin [2014]).},

  abstract = {Significant volumes of research over the past four decades has sought to elucidate the social, infrastructural, economic, and human health effects of climate change induced surface flooding. To date, epidemiological and public health studies of flooding events have focused on mental health effects, vector-borne diseases, and infectious enteric disease due to floodwater contact (i.e. typically low consumption rates). The inherent nature of groundwater (i.e. out of sight, out of mind) and the widely held belief that aquifers represent a pristine source of drinking water due to natural attenuation may represent the ``perfect storm'' causing direct consumption of relatively large volumes of surface flood-contaminated groundwater. Accordingly, the current study sought to systematically identify and synthesize all available peer-reviewed literature pertaining to the nexus between surface flooding, groundwater contamination and human gastroenteric outcomes. Just 14 relevant studies were found to have been published during the period 1980\textendash 2017, thus highlighting the fact that this potentially significant source of climate-related exposure to environmental infection has remained understudied to date. Studies differed significantly in terms of type and data reporting procedures, making it difficult to discern clear trends and patterns. Approximately 945 confirmed cases of flood-related enteric disease were examined across studies; these concurred with almost 10,000 suspected cases, equating to approximately 20 suspected cases per confirmed case. As such, no regional, national or global estimates are available for the human gastrointestinal health burden of flood-related groundwater contamination. In light of the demonstrable public health significance of the concurrent impacts of groundwater susceptibility and climate change exacerbation, strategies to increase awareness about potential sources of contamination and motivate precautionary behaviour (e.g. drinking water testing and treatment, supply interruptions) are necessary. Mainstreaming climate adaptation concerns into planning policies will also be necessary to reduce human exposure to waterborne sources of enteric infection.}

  abstract = {Hydropower plants frequently operate at high output during peak hours and at low output (or even shutoff) during off-peak hours. This scheme, called ``hydropeaking'', is harmful to downstream ecosystems. Operational constraints (minimum flows, maximum ramps) are frequently used to mitigate the impacts of hydropeaking. However, they reduce the operational flexibility of hydroelectric dams and increase the operational cost of power systems. Another approach to mitigating ecological impacts from hydropeaking is using structural measures, such as re-regulation reservoirs or afterbays. The first contribution of our work is to study the cost-effectiveness of these re-regulation reservoirs in mitigating ecological impacts from subdaily hydropeaking. Our second contribution is assessing energy storage (specifically, batteries) to mitigate the financial impacts of implementing peaking restrictions on dams, which represents the first attempt in the literature. Understanding these mitigation options is relevant for new hydropower dams, as well as for existing ones undergoing relicensing processes. For this, we formulate an hourly mixed-integer linear optimization model to simulate the annual operation of a power system. We then compare the business-as-usual (unconstrained) hydropower operations with ecologically constrained operations. The constrained operation, by limiting hydropower ramping rates, showed to obtain flows close to the natural streamflow regime. As next step, we show how re-regulation reservoirs and batteries can help to achieve these ecological constraints at lower costs. While the former are cost-effective for a very broad range of investment costs, the latter will be cost-effective for hydropeaking mitigation from 2025 onwards, when their capital costs have fallen. If more stringent environmental constraints are imposed, both solutions become significantly more attractive. The same holds for scenarios of more renewable generation (in which the operational flexibility from both alternatives becomes more valuable). After 2030, batteries can match the cost-effectiveness of expensive re-regulation reservoirs. Our findings are valuable for policy and decision makers in energy and ecosystem conservation.}

A thing or system that is easily harmed by randomness is fragile. We argue that, contrary to their appearance, big capital investments break easily - i.e. deliver negative net present value - due to various sources of uncertainty that impact them during their long gestation, implementation, and operation periods. We do not refute the existence of economies of scale and scope. Instead we argue that big capital investments have a disproportionate (non-linear) exposure to uncertainties that deliver poor or negative returns above and beyond their economies of scale and scope. We further argue that to succeed, leaders of capital projects need to carefully consider where scaling pays off and where it does not. To automatically assume that "bigger is better," which is common in megaproject management, is a recipe for failure.},

Based on the largest dataset of its kind, this paper punctures the twin myths that, first, infrastructure creates economic value, and, second, China has a distinct advantage in its delivery. Far from being an engine of economic growth, the typical infrastructure investment fails to deliver a positive risk adjusted return. Moreover, China's track record in delivering infrastructure is no better than that of rich democracies. Where investments are debt-financed, overinvesting in unproductive projects results in the buildup of debt, monetary expansion, instability in financial markets, and economic fragility, exactly as we see in China today. We conclude that poorly managed infrastructure investments are a main explanation of surfacing economic and financial problems in China. We predict that, unless China shifts to a lower level of higher-quality infrastructure investments, the country is headed for an infrastructure-led national financial and economic crisis, which is likely also to be a crisis for the international economy. China's infrastructure investment model is not one to follow for other countries but one to avoid.}

We investigate this question with the ``outside view'' or ``reference class forecasting'' based on literature on decision-making under uncertainty in psychology. We find overwhelming evidence that budgets are systematically biased below actual costs of large hydropower dams\textemdash excluding inflation, substantial debt servicing, environmental, and social costs. Using the largest and most reliable reference data of its kind and multilevel statistical techniques applied to large dams for the first time, we were successful in fitting parsimonious models to predict cost and schedule overruns. The outside view suggests that in most countries large hydropower dams will be too costly in absolute terms and take too long to build to deliver a positive risk-adjusted return unless suitable risk management measures outlined in this paper can be affordably provided. Policymakers, particularly in developing countries, are advised to prefer agile energy alternatives that can be built over shorter time horizons to energy megaprojects.}

However, this potential has not been yet fully explored. Here, a methodological framework is designed for the spatial frequency analysis of extreme precipitation (P) with radar QPEs that leads to realistic quantile patterns while reducing the sampling uncertainty. The framework was applied with 19~years of QPEs from 1-h, 4-km Stage IV reanalysis from the Next Generation Weather Radar (NEXRAD) network and robustly tested against (1) a network of 204 high-resolution rain gages in central Arizona with one of the largest densities and spatial coverages in the world, and (2) extreme P quantiles from NOAA Atlas 14. It was first showed that (1) the generalized extreme value (GEV) is a suitable distribution to model the series of annual P maxima of gage records and radar QPEs across multiple durations from 1~h to 24~h, and (2) correcting the bias of the GEV shape parameter estimates due to the short sample size is a critical step. Spatial estimates of extreme P quantiles were then obtained through a hierarchical approach based on the index-flood method and the spatial smoothening (interpolation) of the GEV parameters estimated from radar QPEs (gage records). For each parameter, the most effective interpolation method was identified that limits the uncertainty caused by the short sample size and captures the local variability of extreme P. The extreme P quantiles generated from radar QPEs exhibited similar or, in some cases, higher accuracy than those generated by interpolating sparse gage information and exhibit more realistic patterns. While derived in central Arizona, the insights of this work are useful to incorporate radar QPEs into operational IDF curves in any region of the world monitored by weather radars.}

  abstract = {Distributed attenuation in flood management relies on small and low-impact runoff attenuating features variously distributed within a catchment. Distributed systems of reservoirs, natural flood management, and green infrastructure are practical examples of distributed attenuation. The effectiveness of attenuating features lies in their ability to work in concert, by reducing and slowing runoff in strategic parts of the catchment, and desynchronizing flows. The spatial distribution of attenuating features plays an essential role in the process. This article proposes a framework to place features in a hydrologic network, group them into spatially distributed systems, and analyze their flood attenuation effects. The framework is applied to study distributed systems of reservoirs in a rural watershed in Iowa, USA. The results show that distributed attenuation can be an effective alternative to a single centralized flood mitigation approach. The different flow peak attenuation of considered distributed systems suggest that the spatial distribution of features significantly influences flood magnitude at the catchment scale. The proposed framework can be applied to examine the effectiveness of distributed attenuation, and its viability as a widespread flood attenuation strategy in different landscapes and at multiple scales.},

In the United States, that damage totals more than USD 1 trillion in damages since 1980. On average, direct flood losses have risen from USD 4 billion annually in the 1980s to roughly USD 17 billion annually from 2010 to 2018. Despite flooding\&rsquo;s tremendous economic impact on US properties and communities, current estimates of expected damages are lacking due to the fact that flood risk in many parts of the US is unidentified, underestimated, or available models associated with high quality assessment tools are proprietary. This study introduces an economic-focused Environmental Impact Assessment (EIA) approach that builds upon an our existing understanding of prior assessment methods by taking advantage of a newly available, climate adjusted, parcel-level flood risk assessment model (First Street Foundation, 2020a and 2020b) in order to quantify property level economic impacts today, and into the climate adjusted future, using the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change\&rsquo;s (IPCC) Representative Concentration Pathways (RCPs) and NASA\&rsquo;s Global Climate Model ensemble (CMIP5). This approach represents a first of its kind\&mdash;a publicly available high precision flood risk assessment tool at the property level developed completely with open data sources and open methods. The economic impact assessment presented here has been carried out using residential buildings in New Jersey as a testbed; however, the environmental assessment tool on which it is based is a national scale property level flood assessment model at a 3 m resolution. As evidence of the reliability of the EIA tool, the 2020 estimated economic impact (USD 5481 annual expectation) was compared to actual average per claim-year NFIP payouts from flooding and found an average of USD 5540 over the life of the program (difference of less than USD 100). Additionally, the tool finds a 41.4\% increase in average economic flood damage through the year 2050 when environmental change is included in the model.},

  abstract = {Over the past five decades, several approaches for estimating probabilities of extreme still water levels have been developed. Currently, different methods are applied not only on transnational, but also on national scales, resulting in a heterogeneous level of protection. Applying different statistical methods can yield significantly different estimates of return water levels, but even the use of the same technique can produce large discrepancies, because there is subjective parameter choice at several steps in the model setup. In this paper, we compare probabilities of extreme still water levels estimated using the main direct methods (i.e. the block maxima method and the peaks over threshold method) considering a wide range of strategies to create extreme value dataset and a range of different model setups. We primarily use tide gauge records from the German Bight but also consider data from sites around the UK and Australia for comparison. The focus is on testing the influence of the following three main factors, which can affect the estimates of extreme value statistics: (1) detrending the original data sets; (2) building samples of extreme values from the original data sets; and (3) the record lengths of the original data sets. We find that using different detrending techniques biases the results from extreme value statistics. Hence, we recommend using a 1-year moving average of high waters (or hourly records if these are available) to correct the original data sets for seasonal and long-term sea level changes. Our results highlight that the peaks over threshold method yields more reliable and more stable (i.e. using short records leads to the same results as when using long records) estimates of probabilities of extreme still water levels than the block maxima method. In analysing a variety of threshold selection methods we find that using the 99.7th percentile water level leads to the most stable return water level estimates along the German Bight. This is also valid for the international stations considered. Finally, to provide guidance for coastal engineers and operators, we recommend the peaks over threshold method and define an objective approach for setting up the model. If this is applied routinely around a country, it will help overcome the problem of heterogeneous levels of protection resulting from different methods and varying model setups.}

This is also true of other policies, e.g., affecting nuclear waste disposal or the construction of long-lived infrastructure.

  abstract = {In September 2011, the US Environmental Protection Agency asked 12 economists how the benefits and costs of regulations should be discounted for projects that affect future generations. This paper summarizes the views of the panel on three topics: the use of the Ramsey formula as an organizing principle for determining discount rates over long horizons, whether the discount rate should decline over time, and how intra- and intergenerational discounting practices can be made compatible. The panel members agree that the Ramsey formula provides a useful framework for thinking about intergenerational discounting. We also agree that theory provides compelling arguments for a declining certainty-equivalent discount rate. In the Ramsey formula, uncertainty about the future rate of growth in per capita consumption can lead to a declining consumption rate of discount, assuming that shocks to consumption are positively correlated. This uncertainty in future consumption growth rates may be estimated econometrically based on historic observations, or it can be derived from subjective uncertainty about the mean rate of growth in mean consumption or its volatility. Determining the remaining parameters of the Ramsey formula is, however, challenging.}

Analyses highlight the spatial variability in these hazards, their temporal changes in terms of frequency and magnitude, and their connection to large-scale climate, in particular to the North Atlantic Oscillation (NAO) and El Ni\~no-Southern Oscillation (ENSO). We use long-term stream and rain gage measurements, and our analyses are based on annual maxima (AMs) and peaks-over-threshold (POTs). TCs contribute to {$\sim$}20\textendash 30\% of AMs and POTs over Florida and coastal areas of the eastern United States, and the contribution decreases as we move inland. We do not detect statistically significant trends in the magnitude or frequency of TC floods. Regarding the role of climate, NAO and ENSO do not play a large role in controlling the frequency and magnitude of TC flooding. The connection between heavy rainfall and TCs is comparable to what observed in terms of flooding. Unlike flooding, NAO plays a significant role in TC-related extreme rainfall along the U.S. East Coast, while ENSO is most strongly linked to the TC precipitation in Texas.}

  abstract = {Exposure has amplified rapidly over the past half century and is one of the primary drivers of increases in disaster frequency and consequences. Previous research on exposure change detection has proven limited since the geographic units of aggregation for decennial censuses, the sole measure of accurate historical population and housing counts, vary from one census to the next. To address this shortcoming, this research produces a set of gridded population and housing data for the Chicago, Illinois, region to evaluate the concept of the ``expanding bull's-eye effect.'' This effect argues that ``targets''\textemdash people and their built environments\textemdash of geophysical hazards are enlarging as populations grow and spread. A collection of observationally derived synthetic violent tornadoes are transposed across fine-geographic-scale population and housing unit grids at different time stamps to appraise the concept. Results reveal that intensifying and expanding development is placing more people and their possessions in the potential path of tornadoes, increasing the likelihood of tornado disasters. The research demonstrates how different development morphologies lead to varying exposure rates that contribute to the unevenness of potential weather-related disasters across the landscape. In addition, the investigation appraises the viability of using a gridded framework for assessing changes in census-derived exposure data. The creation of uniformly sized grid data on a scale smaller than counties, municipalities, and conventional census geographic units addresses two of the most critical problems assessing historical changes in disaster frequencies and magnitudes\textemdash highly variable spatial units of exposure data and the mismatch between spatial scales of population/housing data and hazards.}

  abstract = {The impact of recent flood events, such as hurricane Harvey in 2017 which affected the upper Texas coastal region, has sparked new proposals for buying out damaged properties to reduce flood risk and return them to natural open space. Traditionally, buyouts have been carried out with little regard for non-monetary benefits, such as ecological and aesthetic values, but have been driven by a cost\textendash benefit calculus that leads to a reactionary, ad hoc selection process after a flood event has already occurred. This standard practice can result in a disjointed pattern of open spaces that does little to protect environmental assets. In response to the lack of research that also considers the complementary ecological benefits of buyout programmes, this study tests a methodological framework that identifies candidate parcels for acquisition along a spectrum of ecological and proximity variables, by statistically and spatially identifying the nexus between ecological value and economic benefits when acquiring flooded properties. Importantly, we show that including these criteria does not significantly reduce the cost-effectiveness of buyouts and that acquiring parcels for flood risk reduction can be combined with protecting ecological values in a way that helps communities to become more resilient over the long term.}

Aligned with the behavioral economics literature, recent flood events temporarily increase purchases, but this effect fades after 3years.

Contrary to what is often assumed, we do not find evidence that insurance purchase and mitigation efforts are substitutes. Educated individuals, individuals over the age of 45, and African-Americans are, all else equal, more likely to purchase flood insurance.}

The empirical literature has shown significant increases in climate-driven impacts on overall consumption, yet has not focused on the cost implications of the increased intensity and frequency of extreme events driving peak demand, which is the highest load observed in a period. We use comprehensive, high-frequency data at the level of load balancing authorities to parameterize the relationship between average or peak electricity demand and temperature for a major economy. Using statistical models, we analyze multiyear data from 166 load balancing authorities in the United States. We couple the estimated temperature response functions for total daily consumption and daily peak load with 18 downscaled global climate models (GCMs) to simulate climate change-driven impacts on both outcomes. We show moderate and heterogeneous changes in consumption, with an average increase of 2.8\% by end of century. The results of our peak load simulations, however, suggest significant increases in the intensity and frequency of peak events throughout the United States, assuming today's technology and electricity market fundamentals. As the electricity grid is built to endure maximum load, our findings have significant implications for the construction of costly peak generating capacity, suggesting additional peak capacity costs of up to 180 billion dollars by the end of the century under business-as-usual.}

  abstract = {Regulation is a key concern of industries, consumers, citizens, and governments alike. Building on the success of the first edition, Understanding Regulation, Second Edition provides the reader with an introduction to key debates and discussions in the field of regulation from a number of disciplinary perspectives, looking towards law, economics, business, political science, sociology, and social administration.The book has been extensively revised and updated to take into account the significant developments and events of the past decade. Containing several new chapters, it has been completely restructured into seven parts, covering: the fundamental issues regarding regulation; different types of regulatory strategies; rules and enforcement; quality and evaluation; regulation at different levels of government; network issues; and concluding thoughts.Drawing on cross-sectoral and cross-national examples, this book reviews the central questions of regulation, and reflects upon those contentious issues that affect the design and operation of regulatory institutions. Amongst other topics, it discusses 'better regulation', enforcement, self-regulation, risk regulation, cost-benefit analysis, and more utility regulation-oriented topics, such as price-setting. It will be an essential resource for academics, researchers, and graduates across thesocial sciences studying regulation.},

  abstract = {Based on fieldwork among state officials, NGOs, politicians, and activists in Costa Rica and Brazil, A Future History of Water traces the unspectacular work necessary to make water access a human right~and a human right something different from a commodity. Andrea Ballestero shows how these ephemeral distinctions are made through four technolegal devices\textemdash formula, index, list and pact. She argues that what is at stake in these devices is not the making of a distinct future~but what counts as the future in the first place. A Future History of Water is an ethnographically rich and conceptually charged journey into ant-filled water meters, fantastical water taxonomies, promises captured on slips of paper, and statistical maneuvers that dissolve the human of human rights. Ultimately, Ballestero demonstrates what happens when instead of trying to fix its meaning, we make water's changing form the precondition of our analyses.},

  abstract = {Despite considerable advances in process understanding, numerical modeling, and the observational record of ice sheet contributions to global mean sea-level rise (SLR) since the Fifth Assessment Report (AR5) of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change, severe limitations remain in the predictive capability of ice sheet models. As a consequence, the potential contributions of ice sheets remain the largest source of uncertainty in projecting future SLR. Here, we report the findings of a structured expert judgement study, using unique techniques for modeling correlations between inter- and intra-ice sheet processes and their tail dependences. We find that since the AR5, expert uncertainty has grown, in particular because of uncertain ice dynamic effects. For a +2 \textdegree C temperature scenario consistent with the Paris Agreement, we obtain a median estimate of a 26 cm SLR contribution by 2100, with a 95th percentile value of 81 cm. For a +5 \textdegree C temperature scenario more consistent with unchecked emissions growth, the corresponding values are 51 and 178 cm, respectively. Inclusion of thermal expansion and glacier contributions results in a global total SLR estimate that exceeds 2 m at the 95th percentile. Our findings support the use of scenarios of 21st century global total SLR exceeding 2 m for planning purposes. Beyond 2100, uncertainty and projected SLR increase rapidly. The 95th percentile ice sheet contribution by 2200, for the +5 \textdegree C scenario, is 7.5 m as a result of instabilities coming into play in both West and East Antarctica. Introducing process correlations and tail dependences increases estimates by roughly 15\%.}

  abstract = {AbstractClimate models project that heavy precipitation events intensify with climate change. It is generally accepted that extreme day-long events will increase at a rate of about 6\textendash 7\% per degree warming, consistent with the Clausius-Clapeyron relation. However, recent studies suggest that subdaily (e.g., hourly) precipitation extremes may increase at about twice this rate. Conventional climate models are not suited to assess such events, due to the limited spatial resolution and the need to parametrize convective precipitation (i.e., thunderstorms and rain showers). Here we employ a convection-resolving model using a horizontal grid spacing of 2.2 km across an extended region covering the Alps and its larger-scale surrounding from northern Italy to northern Germany. Consistent with previous results, projections using a Representative Concentration Pathways version 8.5 greenhouse gas scenario reveal a significant decrease of mean summer precipitation. However, unlike previous studies, we find that both extreme day-long and hour-long precipitation events asymptotically intensify with the Clausius-Clapeyron relation. Differences to previous studies might be due to the model or region considered, but we also show that it is inconsistent to extrapolate from present-day precipitation scaling into the future.}

  abstract = {Increased urbanization, infrastructure degradation, and climate change threaten to overwhelm stormwater systems across the nation, rendering them ineffective. Green Infrastructure (GI) practices are low cost, low regret strategies that can contribute to urban runoff management. However, questions remain as to how to best distribute GI practices through urban watersheds given precipitation uncertainty and the variable hydrological responses to them. We develop stochastic programming models to determine the optimal placement of GI practices across a set of candidate locations in a watershed to minimize the total expected runoff under medium-term precipitation uncertainties. Specifically, we first develop a two-stage stochastic programming model. Next, we reformulate this model using perturbed parameters to reduce the requisite computational time and extend it to multi-stage. In addition, we introduce constraints that allow for incorporating sub-catchment-level runoff reduction considerations. We account for hydrological connectivity in the watershed using an underlying acyclic connectivity graph of sub-catchments and incorporate various practical considerations into the models. In addition, we develop a systemic approach to downscale the existing daily precipitation projections into hourly units and efficiently estimate the corresponding hydrological responses. These advancements are brought together in a case study for an urban watershed in a mid-sized city in the U.S., where we perform sensitivity analyses, evaluate the importance of the considered constraints, and provide insights.}

We introduce three alternative estimators of {$\rho$} which are nearly unbiased and exhibit much less variability than r for non-normal data. We also document remarkable upward bias and tremendous increases in variability associated with r using both synthetic data and daily streamflow simulations from 905 calibrated rainfall\textendash runoff models. We show that estimators of {$\rho$} = R accounting for skewness are needed for daily streamflow series because they exhibit high variability and skewness compared to, for example, monthly/annual series, where r should perform well.}

  abstract = {In this paper, empirical data are used to estimate the parameters of a sociohydrological flood risk model. The proposed model, which describes the interactions between floods, settlement density, awareness, preparedness, and flood loss, is based on the literature. Data for the case study of Dresden, Germany, over a period of 200 years, are used to estimate the model parameters through Bayesian inference. The credibility bounds of their estimates are small, even though the data are rather uncertain. A sensitivity analysis is performed to examine the value of the different data sources in estimating the model parameters. In general, the estimated parameters are less biased when using data at the end of the modeled period. Data about flood awareness are the most important to correctly estimate the parameters of this model and to correctly model the system dynamics. Using more data for other variables cannot compensate for the absence of awareness data. More generally, the absence of data mostly affects the estimation of the parameters that are directly related to the variable for which data are missing. This paper demonstrates that combining sociohydrological modeling and empirical data gives additional insights into the sociohydrological system, such as quantifying the forgetfulness of the society, which would otherwise not be easily achieved by sociohydrological models without data or by standard statistical analysis of empirical data.},

  abstract = {Canonical correlation analysis (CCA) is explored as a multivariate linear statistical methodology with which to forecast fluctuations of the El Ni\~no/Southern Oscillation (ENSO) in real time. CCA is capable of identifying critical sequence of predictor patterns that tend to evolve into subsequent patterns that can be used to form a forecast. The CCA model is used to forecast the 3-month mean sea surface temperature (SST) in several regions of the tropical Pacific and Indian oceans for projection times of 0 to 4 seasons beyond the immediately forthcoming season. The predictor variables, representing the climate situation in the four consecutive 3-month periods ending at the time of the forecast, are 1) quasi-global seasonal mean sea level pressure (SLP) and 2) SST in the predictand regions themselves. Forecast skill is estimated using cross-validation, and persistence is used as the primary skill control measure. Results indicate that a large region in the eastern equatorial Pacific (120\textdegree -170\textdegree W longitude) has the highest overall predictability, with excellent skill realized for winter forecasts made at the end of summer. CCA outperforms persistence in this region under most conditions, and does noticeably better with the SST included as a predictor in addition to the SLP. It is demonstrated that better forecast performance at the longer lead times would be obtained if some significantly earlier (i.e., up to 4 years) predictor data were included, because the ability to predict the lower-frequency ENSO phase changes would increase. The good performance of the current system at shorter lead times appears to be based largely on the ability to predict ENSO evolution for events already in progress. The forecasting of the eastern tropical Pacific SST using CCA is now done routinely on a monthly basis for a 0-, 1-, and 2-season lead at the Climate Analysis Center. Further refinements, and expected associated increases in skill, are planned for the coming several years.}

  abstract = {Climate change may constrain future electricity supply adequacy by reducing electric transmission capacity and increasing electricity demand. The carrying capacity of electric power cables decreases as ambient air temperatures rise; similarly, during the summer peak period, electricity loads typically increase with hotter air temperatures due to increased air conditioning usage. As atmospheric carbon concentrations increase, higher ambient air temperatures may strain power infrastructure by simultaneously reducing transmission capacity and increasing peak electricity load. We estimate the impacts of rising ambient air temperatures on electric transmission ampacity and peak per-capita electricity load for 121 planning areas in the United States using downscaled global climate model projections. Together, these planning areas account for roughly 80\% of current peak summertime load. We estimate climate-attributable capacity reductions to transmission lines by constructing thermal models of representative conductors, then forcing these models with future temperature projections to determine the percent change in rated ampacity. Next, we assess the impact of climate change on electricity load by using historical relationships between ambient temperature and utility-scale summertime peak load to estimate the extent to which climate change will incur additional peak load increases. We find that by mid-century (2040\textendash 2060), increases in ambient air temperature may reduce average summertime transmission capacity by 1.9\%\textendash 5.8\% relative to the 1990\textendash 2010 reference period. At the same time, peak per-capita summertime loads may rise by 4.2\%\textendash 15\% on average due to increases in ambient air temperature. In the absence of energy efficiency gains, demand-side management programs and transmission infrastructure upgrades, these load increases have the potential to upset current assumptions about future electricity supply adequacy.}

Associated severe impacts highlight the need for understanding the physical drivers of the heatwave and relations to climate change, to improve the projection and prediction of future extreme heat risks. Here, we find that slow- and fast-moving components of the atmospheric circulation interacted, along with regional soil moisture deficiency, to trigger a 5-sigma heat event. Its severity was amplified \textasciitilde 40\% by nonlinear interactions between its drivers, probably driven in part by land\textendash atmosphere feedbacks catalysed by long-term regional warming and soil drying. Since the 1950s, global warming has transformed the peak daily regional temperature anomaly of the event from virtually impossible to a presently estimated \textasciitilde 200-yearly occurrence. Its likelihood is projected to increase rapidly with further global warming, possibly becoming a 10-yearly occurrence in a climate 2\,\textdegree C warmer than the pre-industrial period, which may be reached by 2050.},

  abstract = {Flood hazard across the western United States (US) has generally shown decreasing trends in recent decades. This region's extreme streamflow is highly influenced by natural variability, which could either mask or amplify anthropogenic streamflow trends. In this study, we utilize a technique known as dynamical adjustment to assess historical (1970\textendash 2020) annual maximum 1-day streamflow (Qx1d) from unregulated basins across the western US with and without the impact of natural variability. After removing natural variability, the fraction of basins with a positive ({$>$}5\%) trend in Qx1d shifts from 25\% to 53\%. Basins with increasing (decreasing) Qx1d trends after dynamical adjustment exhibit weak (strong) drying, and furthermore are associated with intensifying precipitation extremes and/or large decreases in snowpack. Increasing flood hazard will likely emerge for such basins as the current phase of natural decadal variability shifts, and anthropogenic signals continue to intensify.}

  abstract = {River floods are among the most common natural disasters worldwide, with substantial economic and humanitarian costs. Despite enormous efforts, gauging the risk of extreme floods with unprecedented magnitude is an outstanding challenge. Limited observational data from very high-magnitude flood events hinders prediction efforts and the identification of discharge thresholds marking the rise of progressively larger floods, termed flood divides. Combining long hydroclimatic records and a process-based model for flood hazard assessment, here we demonstrate that the spatial organization of stream networks and the river flow regime control the appearance of flood divides and extreme floods. In contrast with their ubiquitous attribution to extreme rainfall and anomalous antecedent conditions, we show that the propensity to generate extreme floods is well predicted by intrinsic properties of river basins. Most importantly, it can be assessed prior to the occurrence of catastrophes through measurable metrics of these properties derived from commonly available discharge data, namely the hydrograph recession exponent and the coefficient of variation of daily flows. These results highlight the propensity of certain rivers for generating extreme floods and demonstrate the importance of using hazard mapping tools that, rather than solely relying on past flood records, identify regions susceptible to the occurrence of extreme floods from ordinary discharge dynamics.},

Specific improvements include updated hydrography data, new methods to determine channel depth, more rigorous flood frequency analysis, output downscaling to property tract level, and inclusion of the impact of local interventions in the flooding system. For the first time, we consider pluvial, fluvial, and coastal flood hazards within the same framework and provide projections for both current (rather than historic average) conditions and for future time periods centered on 2035 and 2050 under the RCP4.5 emissions pathway. Validation against high-quality local models and the entire catalog of FEMA 1\% annual probability flood maps yielded Critical Success Index values in the range 0.69\textendash 0.82. Significant improvements over a previous pluvial/fluvial model version are shown for high-frequency events and coastal zones, along with minor improvements in areas where model performance was already good. The result is the first comprehensive and consistent national-scale analysis of flood hazard for the conterminous US for both current and future conditions. Even though we consider a stabilization emissions scenario and a near-future time horizon, we project clear patterns of changing flood hazard (3{$\sigma$} changes in 100 years inundated area of -3.8 to +16\% at 1\textdegree{} scale), that are significant when considered as a proportion of the land area where human use is possible or in terms of the currently protected land area where the standard of flood defense protection may become compromised by this time.}

However, applications to science remain limited because of the impracticability of rewriting complex scientific simulators in a PPL, the computational cost of inference, and the lack of scalable implementations. To address these, we present a novel PPL framework that couples directly to existing scientific simulators through a cross-platform probabilistic execution protocol and provides Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) and deep-learning-based inference compilation (IC) engines for tractable inference. To guide IC inference, we perform distributed training of a dynamic 3DCNN--LSTM architecture with a PyTorch-MPI-based framework on 1,024 32-core CPU nodes of the Cori supercomputer with a global minibatch size of 128k: achieving a performance of 450 Tflop/s through enhancements to PyTorch. We demonstrate a Large Hadron Collider (LHC) use-case with the C++ Sherpa simulator and achieve the largest-scale posterior inference in a Turing-complete PPL.},

  abstract = {A hierarchical Bayesian model is proposed to quantify the magnitude of extreme surges on the Atlantic coast of Canada with limited data. Generalized extreme value distributions are fitted to surges derived from water levels measured at 21 buoys along the coast. The parameters of these distributions are linked together through a Gaussian field whose mean and variance are driven by atmospheric sea-level pressure and the distance between stations, respectively. This allows for information sharing across the original stations and for interpolation anywhere along the coast. The use of a copula at the data level of the hierarchy further accounts for the dependence between locations, allowing for inference beyond a site-by-site basis. It is shown how the extreme surges derived from the model can be combined with the tidal process to predict potentially catastrophic water levels.}

  abstract = {Decades of research has concluded that the percent of impervious surface cover in a watershed is strongly linked to negative impacts on urban stream health. Recently, there has been a push by municipalities to offset these effects by installing structural stormwater control measures (SCMs), which are landscape features designed to retain and reduce runoff to mitigate the effects of urbanisation on event hydrology. The goal of this study is to build generalisable relationships between the level of SCM implementation in urban watersheds and resulting changes to hydrology. A literature review of 185 peer-reviewed studies of watershed-scale SCM implementation across the globe was used to identify 52 modelling studies suitable for a meta-analysis to build statistical relationships between SCM implementation and hydrologic change. Hydrologic change is quantified as the percent reduction in storm event runoff volume and peak flow between a watershed with SCMs relative to a (near) identical control watershed without SCMs. Results show that for each additional 1\% of SCM-mitigated impervious area in a watershed, there is an additional 0.43\% reduction in runoff and a 0.60\% reduction in peak flow. Values of SCM implementation required to produce a change in water quantity metrics were identified at varying levels of probability. For example, there is a 90\% probability (high confidence) of at least a 1\% reduction in peak flow with mitigation of 33\% of impervious surfaces. However, as the reduction target increases or mitigated impervious surface decreases, the probability of reaching the reduction target also decreases. These relationships can be used by managers to plan SCM implementation at the watershed scale.}

  abstract = {Info-Gap (IG) Decision Theory is a method for prioritizing alternatives and making choices and decisions under deep uncertainty. An ``info-gap'' is the disparity between what is known and what needs to be known for a responsible decision. Info-gap analysis does not presume knowledge of a worst-case or of reliable probability distributions. Info-gap models of uncertainty represent uncertainty in parameters and in the shapes of functional relationships. IG Decision Theory offers two decision concepts: robustness and opportuneness. The robustness of an alternative is the greatest horizon of uncertainty up to which that alternative satisfies critical outcome requirements. The robustness strategy satisfices the outcome and maximizes the immunity to error or surprise. This differs from outcome optimization. The robustness function demonstrates the trade-off between immunity to error and quality of outcome. It shows that knowledge-based predicted outcomes have no robustness to uncertainty in that knowledge. The opportuneness of a decision alternative is the lowest horizon of uncertainty at which that decision enables better-than-anticipated outcomes. The opportuneness strategy seeks windfalls at minimal uncertainty. We discuss ``innovation dilemmas'' in which the decisionmaker must choose between two alternatives, where one is putatively better but more uncertain than the other. Two examples of info-gap analysis are presented, one quantitative that uses mathematics and one qualitative that uses only verbal analysis.},

  abstract = {This paper describes a solution technique for Linear Programming problems with multiple objective functions. In this type of problem it is often necessary to replace the concept of ``optimum'' with that of ``best compromise''. In contrast with methods dealing with a priori weighted sums of the objective functions, the method described here involves a sequential exploration of solutions. This exploration is guided to some extent by the decision maker who intervenes by means of defined responses to precise questions posed by the algorithm. Thus, in this man-model symbiosis, phases of computation alternate with phases of decision. The process allows the decision-maker to ``learn'' to recognize good solutions and the relative importance of the objectives. The final decision (best compromise) furnished by the man-model system is obtained after a small number of successive phases.}

  abstract = {This paper is about the problem of learning a stochastic policy for generating an object (like a molecular graph) from a sequence of actions, such that the probability of generating an object is proportional to a given positive reward for that object. Whereas standard return maximization tends to converge to a single return-maximizing sequence, there are cases where we would like to sample a diverse set of high-return solutions. These arise, for example, in black-box function optimization when few rounds are possible, each with large batches of queries, where the batches should be diverse, e.g., in the design of new molecules. One can also see this as a problem of approximately converting an energy function to a generative distribution. While MCMC methods can achieve that, they are expensive and generally only perform local exploration. Instead, training a generative policy amortizes the cost of search during training and yields to fast generation. Using insights from Temporal Difference learning, we propose GFlowNet, based on a view of the generative process as a flow network, making it possible to handle the tricky case where different trajectories can yield the same final state, e.g., there are many ways to sequentially add atoms to generate some molecular graph. We cast the set of trajectories as a flow and convert the flow consistency equations into a learning objective, akin to the casting of the Bellman equations into Temporal Difference methods. We prove that any global minimum of the proposed objectives yields a policy which samples from the desired distribution, and demonstrate the improved performance and diversity of GFlowNet on a simple domain where there are many modes to the reward function, and on a molecule synthesis task.},

  abstract = {A relational database using Access, and an interface based on a Geographical Information System (GIS) with ArcView program, were created to allow spatial-temporal analysis of documentary flood data collected for the Tagus basin (Central Spain). High flood frequencies were registered in the periods: AD 1160\textendash 1210 (3\%), 1540\textendash 1640 (11\%; peak at 1590\textendash 1610), 1730\textendash 1760 (5\%), 1780\textendash 1810 (4\%), 1870\textendash 1900 (19\%), 1930\textendash 1950 (17\%) and 1960\textendash 1980 (12\%). Flood magnitudes of those documentary events were estimated at four sites (Aranjuez, Toledo, Talavera and Alc\'antara) along the Tagus River using HEC-RAS Computer program, matching the calculated water surface profiles with historical references of flood stage. The largest floods took place during the periods AD 1168\textendash 1211 (Toledo and Talavera), AD 1658\textendash 1706 (Talavera), AD 1870\textendash 1900, and AD 1930\textendash 1950 (Aranjuez, Toledo, Talavera and Alc\'antara). The temporal distribution of flood magnitude and frequency is discussed within the context of climatic variability experienced by the Iberian Peninsula. Although flood producing mechanisms of Atlantic and Mediterranean basins of the Iberian Peninsula are related to different, independent atmospheric patterns, there is a clear coincidence between most periods showing high flood frequencies. These periods of high flooding seem to correspond to the initial and final decades of periods with climate deterioration described at the continental scale. This suggests that climatic variability over the last millennium has induced a response in hydrological extremes (positive or negative), irrespective of the flood-producing mechanism.}

This paper reviews techniques available across various fields for characterising the performance of environmental models with focus on numerical, graphical and qualitative methods. General classes of direct value comparison, coupling real and modelled values, preserving data patterns, indirect metrics based on parameter values, and data transformations are discussed. In practice environmental modelling requires the use and implementation of workflows that combine several methods, tailored to the model purpose and dependent upon the data and information available. A five-step procedure for performance evaluation of models is suggested, with the key elements including: (i) (re)assessment of the model's aim, scale and scope; (ii) characterisation of the data for calibration and testing; (iii) visual and other analysis to detect under- or non-modelled behaviour and to gain an overview of overall performance; (iv) selection of basic performance criteria; and (v) consideration of more advanced methods to handle problems such as systematic divergence between modelled and observed values.}

  abstract = {Deep learning techniques have been increasingly used in flood management to overcome the limitations of accurate, yet slow, numerical models and to improve the results of traditional methods for flood mapping. In this paper, we review 58 recent publications to outline the state of the art of the field, identify knowledge gaps, and propose future research directions. The review focuses on the type of deep learning models used for various flood mapping applications, the flood types considered, the spatial scale of the studied events, and the data used for model development. The results show that models based on convolutional layers are usually more accurate, as they leverage inductive biases to better process the spatial characteristics of the flooding events. Models based on fully connected layers, instead, provide accurate results when coupled with other statistical models. Deep learning models showed increased accuracy when compared to traditional approaches and increased speed when compared to numerical methods. While there exist several applications in flood susceptibility, inundation, and hazard mapping, more work is needed to understand how deep learning can assist in real-time flood warning during an emergency and how it can be employed to estimate flood risk. A major challenge lies in developing deep learning models that can generalize to unseen case studies. Furthermore, all reviewed models and their outputs are deterministic, with limited considerations for uncertainties in outcomes and probabilistic predictions. The authors argue that these identified gaps can be addressed by exploiting recent fundamental advancements in deep learning or by taking inspiration from developments in other applied areas. Models based on graph neural networks and neural operators can work with arbitrarily structured data and thus should be capable of generalizing across different case studies and could account for complex interactions with the natural and built environment. Physics-based deep learning can be used to preserve the underlying physical equations resulting in more reliable speed-up alternatives for numerical models. Similarly, probabilistic models can be built by resorting to deep Gaussian processes or Bayesian neural networks.}

Standard physically based numerical models are often too slow for the use in real-time forecasting systems. Data driven models have small computational costs and fast computation times and may be useful to overcome this problem. The present study presents an artificial neural network based model for the prediction of maximum water levels during a flash flood event. The challenge of finding a suitable structure for the neural network was solved with a new growing algorithm. The model is successfully tested for spatially uniformly distributed synthetic rain events in two real but slightly modified urban catchments with different surface slopes. The computation time of the model in the order of seconds and the accuracy of the results are convincing, which suggest that the method may be useful for real-time forecasts.}

The approach is Bayesian and uses a covariate-dependent infinite mixture model to incorporate multiple time series, with mixture components parameterized by a time varying mean and log spectrum. The mixture components are based on AdaptSPEC, a nonparametric model which adaptively divides the time series into an unknown but finite number of segments and estimates the local log spectra by smoothing splines. We extend AdaptSPEC to handle multiple time series with time varying mean and missing values. Covariates, assumed to be time-independent, are incorporated via the mixture weights using the logistic stick breaking process. The resulting model can estimate time varying means and spectra at both observed and unobserved covariate values, allowing for predictive inference. Estimation is performed by Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) methods, combining data augmentation, reversible jump, and Riemann manifold Hamiltonian Monte Carlo techniques. We evaluate the methodology using simulated data, and describe applications to Australian rainfall data and measles incidence in the US. Efficient software implementing the method proposed in this paper is available in the R package BayesSpec.},

  abstract = {Globally, many countries are actively seeking to maximize the hydropower potential of major river basins, yielding proposals for constructing approximately 3,700 major dams in the near future. At present, economic cost-benefit analyses are the dominant approach for evaluating candidate dam designs. Yet they typically fail to explore the interdependence of dam design and operation by (i) monetizing and aggregating potentially conflicting and heterogeneous objectives into a single metric and (ii) using predefined operating rules aimed at maximizing specific performance objectives for the dams to be designed. Careful consideration of alternative reservoir operating schemes can help to avoid biases in how optimal dam sizes are identified while also clarifying their capacity to adapt to changing hydroclimatic conditions and human demands. This paper presents an integrated framework to solve coupled dam sizing and operation design problems. The framework combines Multiobjective Robust Decision Making and Evolutionary Multiobjective Direct Policy Search into a novel approach to dam sizing, which internalizes the operation design problem and explicitly considers uncertainty in external drivers. We demonstrate the potential of this integrated dam design framework through an ex-post design analysis of the Kariba dam in the Zambezi river basin. Our results show that careful exploration of the coupled planning/operation search space yields designs that significantly outperform the existing Kariba system. Moreover, we demonstrate that our framework leads to a significant reduction in capital costs (i.e., smaller reservoir sizes) while simultaneously improving system robustness with respect to changing hydroclimatology and human irrigation demands.},

  abstract = {The value of streamflow forecasts to inform water infrastructure operations has been extensively studied. Yet, their value in informing infrastructure design is still unexplored. In this work, we investigate how dam design is shaped by information feedbacks supporting the implementation of flexible operating policies informed by streamflow forecasts to enable the design of less costly reservoirs relative to alternatives that do not rely on forecast information. Our approach initially explores the maximum potential gain attainable by searching and using the most valuable forecast information and lead time. We then analyze the results? sensitivities relative to existing and synthetic biased forecasts. We demonstrate our approach through an ex post analysis of the Kariba Dam in the Zambezi River Basin. Results show that informing dam design with perfect forecasts enables attaining the same hydropower production of the existing dam, while reducing infrastructure size and associated capital costs by 20\%. A forecast-informed operation of the existing system can instead facilitate an annual average increase of 60 GWh in hydropower production. This finding, extrapolated to the new planned dams in the basin, suggests that forecast informed policies could yield power production benefits equal to 75\% of the current annual electricity consumption of the Zambian agricultural sector. The use of biased forecasts substantially reduces this gain, showing that the ESP forecasts value is marginal and that informed infrastructure designs are particularly vulnerable to forecast overestimation. Advancing information feedbacks may therefore become a valuable asset for the ongoing hydropower expansion in the basin.},

  abstract = {This study presents a novel approach called scenario-based Fitted Q-Iteration (sFQI) for controlling water reservoir systems under climate uncertainty. In these problems, robust control frameworks, based on worst-case realization, are usually adopted. Yet, these might be overly conservative. In this paper, we use sFQI to design adaptive control policies by enlarging the state space to include the space of the uncertain system's parameters. This allows obtaining a control policy for any scenario in the uncertainty set with a single learning process. The method is demonstrated on a simplified model of the Lake Como system, a regulated lake operated for ensuring reliable water supply to downstream users. Numerical results show that the sFQI algorithm successfully identifies adaptive solutions to operate the system under different inflow scenarios, which outperform the control policy designed under historical conditions. Moreover, the sFQI policy generalizes over inflow scenarios not directly experienced during the policy design, thus alleviating the risk of mis-adaptation, namely the design of a solution fully adapted to a scenario that is different from the one that will actually realize.}

The high complexity and deep uncertainty involved in climate risk management (CRM) lead to individuals' values likely being coupled to and contributing to their understanding of specific climate risk factors and management strategies. Most mental model approaches, however, which are commonly used to inform our understanding of people's beliefs, ignore values. In response, we developed a ``Values-informed Mental Model'' research approach, or ViMM, to elicit individuals' values alongside their beliefs and determine which values people use to understand and assess specific climate risk factors and CRM strategies. Our results show that participants consistently used one of three values to frame their understanding of risk factors and CRM strategies in New Orleans: (1) fostering a healthy economy, wealth, and job creation, (2) protecting and promoting healthy ecosystems and biodiversity, and (3) preserving New Orleans' unique culture, traditions, and historically significant neighborhoods. While the first value frame is common in analyses of CRM strategies, the latter two are often ignored, despite their mirroring commonly accepted pillars of sustainability. Other values like distributive justice and fairness were prioritized differently depending on the risk factor or strategy being discussed. These results suggest that the ViMM method could be a critical first step in CRM decision-support processes and may encourage adoption of CRM strategies more in line with stakeholders' values.},

  abstract = {We use reanalysis data to investigate the daily co-variability of wind and solar irradiance in Britain, and its implications for renewable energy supply balancing. The joint distribution of daily-mean wind speeds and irradiances shows that irradiance has a much stronger seasonal cycle than wind, due to the rotational tilt of the Earth. Irradiance is weakly anticorrelated with wind speed throughout the year (-0.4{$\lessequivlnt\rho\lessequivlnt-$}0.2): there is a weak tendency for windy days to be cloudier. This is particularly true in Atlantic-facing regions (western Scotland, south-west England). The east coast of Britain has the weakest anticorrelation, particularly in winter, primarily associated with a relative increase in the frequency of clear-but-windy days. We also consider the variability in total power output from onshore wind turbines and solar photovoltaic panels. In all months, daily variability in total power is always reduced by incorporating solar capacity. The scenario with the least seasonal variability is approximately 70\%-solar to 30\%-wind. This work emphasises the importance of considering the full distribution of daily behaviour rather than relying on long-term average relationships or correlations. In particular, the anticorrelation between wind and solar power in Britain cannot solely be relied upon to produce a well-balanced energy supply.}

To do so, a novel invalidation approach has been taken to calibrate an ensemble of Dynamic Topmodel parameter sets considered as fit-for-purpose for the prediction of flood peaks. Only 67 realizations out of 100 000 survived evaluation at the peaks of ranked flood hydrographs including the notable 2005, 2009 and 2015 events, together with a process constraint on the minimum area contributing saturation overland flow in the largest storm of record. These 67 events were used as the baseline (before intervention results) to simulate the effect of introducing 1549 storage bunds to temporarily retain saturation overland flows in optimal hillslope locations. The analysis is extended to simulating the reduction of inundation and damage estimates by running the ensemble of Dyanmic Topmodel simulations as inputs to the distributed hydraulic model JFlow for the 2015 Storm Desmond event. Even given such a large number of interventions the effects on the flood peaks and damages in this case were relatively small. The results of the study emphasize the large amounts of storage required in any NFM scheme, with individual features large enough that they are not too quickly overwhelmed, in order to have a significant impact on flood hydrographs and consequent flood damages.}

  abstract = {Projections of future climatic changes are a key input to the design of climate change mitigation and adaptation strategies. Current climate change projections are deeply uncertain. This uncertainty stems from several factors, including parametric and structural uncertainties. One common approach to characterize and, if possible, reduce these uncertainties is to confront (calibrate in a broad sense) the models with historical observations. Here, we analyze the problem of combining multiple climate models using Bayesian Model Averaging (BMA) to derive future projections and quantify uncertainty estimates of spatiotemporally resolved temperature hindcasts and projections. One advantage of the BMA approach is that it allows the assessment of the predictive skill of a model using the training data, which can help identify the better models and discard poor models. Previous BMA approaches have broken important new ground, but often neglected space\textendash time dependencies and/or imposed prohibitive computational demands. Here we improve on the current state-of-the-art by incorporating space\textendash time dependence while using historical data to estimate model weights. We achieve computational efficiency using a kernel mixing approach for representing a space\textendash time process. One key advantage of our new approach is that it enables us to incorporate multiple sources of uncertainty and biases, while remaining computationally tractable for large data sets. We introduce and apply our approach using BMA to an ensemble of Global Circulation Model output from the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change Fourth Assessment Report of surface temperature on a grid of space\textendash time locations.}

[...] It is therefore the policy of my Administration that the Federal Government should pursue a comprehensive approach to advancing equity for all, including people of color and others who have been historically underserved, marginalized, and adversely affected by persistent poverty and inequality. Affirmatively advancing equity, civil rights, racial justice, and equal opportunity is the responsibility of the whole of our Government.

Four sites along the bayou and one site from its input source on the Mississippi River were monitored for water chemistry, total and fecal coliform estimates, and presence of antibiotic-resistant bacteria (ARB) and antibiotic resistance genes (ARG) for a period of 1~year. Four waste-associated bacterial isolates were tested for resistance to antibiotics (tetracycline, sulfamethoxazole/trimethoprim, cefoxitin, meropenem, imipenem, erythromycin, and vancomycin). Resistant bacteria were further examined with PCR/electrophoresis to confirm the presence of antibiotic resistance genes (Sul1, tet(A), tet(W), tet(X), IMP, KPC, and OXA-48). The bayou appears to meet the Louisiana Department of Environmental Quality (LDEQ) criteria for water chemistry, yet fecal coliforms were consistently higher than LDEQ thresholds, thus indicating fecal contamination. Enterobacteriaceae isolates showed 13.6\%, 10.9\%, and 19.8\% resistant to tetracycline, sulfamethoxazole/trimethoprim, and cefoxitin, respectively, and 11 isolates were confirmed for presence of either tet(A) or Sul1 resistance genes. High fecal coliforms and presence of ARB/ARG may both indicate a presence of anthropogenic or agricultural source of fecal contamination.}

  abstract = {Flood risk can be reduced at various stages of the disaster management cycle. Traditionally, permanent infrastructure is used for flood prevention, while residual risk is managed with emergency measures that are triggered by forecasts. Advances in flood forecasting hold promise for a more prominent role to forecast-based measures. In this study, we present a methodology that compares permanent with forecast-based flood-prevention measures. On the basis of this methodology, we demonstrate how operational decision-makers can select between acting against frequent low-impact, and rare high-impact events. Through a hypothetical example, we describe a number of decision scenarios using flood risk indicators for Chikwawa, Malawi, and modelled and forecasted discharge data from 1997 to 2018. The results indicate that the choice between permanent and temporary measures is affected by the cost of measures, climatological flood risk, and forecast ability to produce accurate flood warnings. Temporary measures are likely to be more cost-effective than permanent measures when the probability of flooding is low. Furthermore, a combination of the two types of measures can be the most cost-effective solution, particularly when the forecast is more skillful in capturing low-frequency events. Finally, we show that action against frequent low-impact events could more cost-effective than action against rare high-impact ones. We conclude that forecast-based measures could be used as an alternative to some of the permanent measures rather than being used only to cover the residual risk, and thus, should be taken into consideration when identifying the optimal flood risk strategy.}

To offset the rising cost of floods, the US Congress passed legislation in 2014 that will augment insurance premiums to make the National Flood Insurance Program more actuarially sound. Consequently, there is interest in lowering flood-related costs to the homeowner, both in terms of premiums and damage. This study addresses the issue by integrating premium savings and damages avoided based on several mitigation scenarios. Specifically, it examines how much policyholders within a watershed near Houston, Texas, could have saved between 1999 and 2009 had their communities introduced specific avoidance-based mitigation activities. The results indicate that homeowners and communities can offset premium rises and a majority of the damage suffered through marginal expansions of such initiatives. However, the costs associated with their implementation could counter some of these savings, and hence they need to be considered in future work.},

  abstract = {Abstract: Water resources planning and management efficacy is subject to capturing inherent uncertainties stemming from climatic and hydrological inputs and models. Streamflow forecasts, critical in reservoir operation and water allocation decision making, fundamentally contain uncertainties arising from assumed initial conditions, model structure, and modeled processes. Accounting for these propagating uncertainties remains a formidable challenge. Recent enhancements in climate forecasting skill and hydrological modeling serve as an impetus for further pursuing models and model combinations capable of delivering improved streamflow forecasts. However, little consideration has been given to methodologies that include coupling both multiple climate and multiple hydrological models, increasing the pool of streamflow forecast ensemble members and accounting for cumulative sources of uncertainty. The framework presented here proposes integration and offline coupling of global climate models (GCMs), multiple regional climate models, and numerous water balance models to improve streamflow forecasting through generation of ensemble forecasts. For demonstration purposes, the framework is imposed on the Jaguaribe basin in northeastern Brazil for a hindcast of 1974-1996 monthly streamflow. The ECHAM 4.5 and the NCEP/MRF9 GCMs and regional models, including dynamical and statistical models, are integrated with the ABCD and Soil Moisture Accounting Procedure water balance models. Precipitation hindcasts from the GCMs are downscaled via the regional models and fed into the water balance models, producing streamflow hindcasts. Multi-model ensemble combination techniques include pooling, linear regression weighting, and a kernel density estimator to evaluate streamflow hindcasts; the latter technique exhibits superior skill compared with any single coupled model ensemble hindcast.}

  abstract = {Worldwide, an increase in flood damage is observed. Governments are looking for effective ways to protect lives, buildings, and infrastructure. At the same time, a large investment gap seems to exist\textemdash a big difference between what should necessarily be done to curb the increase in damage and what is actually being done. Decision-makers involved in climate adaptation are facing fundamental (so-called deep) uncertainties. In the course of time, the scientific community has developed a wide range of different approaches for dealing with these uncertainties. One of these approaches, adaptation pathways, is gaining traction as a way of framing and informing climate adaptation. But research shows that ``very little work has been done to evaluate the current use of adaptation pathways and its utility to practitioners and decision makers'' (Lin et al. , p. 387). With this paper, the authors, as action researchers and practitioners involved in two of the world's largest real-life applications of this approach in flood risk management, aim to contribute to filling in that gap. Analysis of the experience in the~United Kingdom and the Netherlands in long-term planning in flood risk management shows that the adaptation pathways approach is effective in keeping decision processes going forward, to the final approval of a long-term plan, and helps increase awareness about uncertainties. It contributes to political support for keeping long-term options open and motivates decision-makers to modify their plans to better accommodate future conditions. When it comes to implementing the plans, there are still some major challenges, yet to be addressed, amongst others: the timely detection of tipping points in situations with large natural variability, the inclusion of measures that prepare for a switch to transformational strategies, and the retention of commitment of regional and local authorities,~non government organizations, and the private sector, to climate adaptation as national policies move from blueprint planning to adaptive plans. In delivering this feedback, the authors hope to motivate the scientific community to take on these challenges.},

Here, we present a novel database on TC characteristics on a global scale using a newly developed synthetic resampling algorithm we call STORM (Synthetic Tropical cyclOne geneRation Model). STORM can be applied to any meteorological dataset to statistically resample and model TC tracks and intensities. We apply STORM to extracted TCs from 38 years of historical data from IBTrACS to statistically extend this dataset to 10,000 years of TC activity. We show that STORM preserves the TC statistics as found in the original dataset. The STORM dataset can be used for TC hazard assessments and risk modeling in TC-prone regions.},

  abstract = {There are concerns that recent climate change is altering the frequency and magnitude of river floods in an unprecedented way1. Historical studies have identified flood-rich periods in the past half millennium in various regions of Europe2. However, because of the low temporal resolution of existing datasets and the relatively low number of series, it has remained unclear whether Europe is currently in a flood-rich period from a long-term perspective. Here we analyse how recent decades compare with the flood history of Europe, using a new database composed of more than 100 high-resolution (sub-annual) historical flood series based on documentary evidence covering all major regions of Europe. We show that the past three decades were among the most flood-rich periods in Europe in the past 500~years, and that this period differs from other flood-rich periods in terms of its extent, air temperatures and flood seasonality. We identified nine flood-rich periods and associated regions. Among the periods richest in floods are 1560\textendash 1580 (western and central Europe), 1760\textendash 1800 (most of Europe), 1840\textendash 1870 (western and southern Europe) and 1990\textendash 2016 (western and central Europe). In most parts of Europe, previous flood-rich periods occurred during cooler-than-usual phases, but the current flood-rich period has been much warmer. Flood seasonality is also more pronounced in the recent period. For example, during previous flood and interflood periods, 41 per cent and 42 per cent of central European floods occurred in summer, respectively, compared with 55 per cent of floods in the recent period. The exceptional nature of the present-day flood-rich period calls for process-based tools for flood-risk assessment that capture the physical mechanisms involved, and management strategies that can incorporate the recent changes in risk.},

  abstract = {Despite consensus that impervious surfaces increase flooding, the magnitude of the increase remains uncertain. This uncertainty largely stems from the challenge of isolating the effect of changes in impervious cover separate from other factors that also affect flooding. To control for these factors, prior study designs rely on either temporal or spatial variation in impervious cover. We leverage both temporal and spatial variation in a panel data regression design to isolate the effect of impervious cover on floods. With 39 years of data from 280 U.S. streamgages, we estimate that a one percentage point increase in impervious basin cover causes a 3.3\% increase in annual flood magnitude (95\%CI: 1.9\%, 4.7\%) on average.

  abstract = {Wind energy is one of the key renewable resources contributing to climate change mitigation policies in national and international energy transition strategies. However, climate change itself can affect the availability of wind resources, due to possible future changes in large-scale circulation pattern. This study aims to understand whether how and to what extent current and future climate change is affecting wind producibility in Italy. In this analysis, the 10~m wind speed from Euro-CORDEX regional climate models was bias-corrected using MERIDA meteorological reanalysis and the wind producibility is calculated, using a reference turbine chosen among the most commonly installed in Italian wind farms. The changes in the availability of wind resources from the reference period 1986\textendash 2005 for the short (2021\textendash 2050), medium (2051\textendash 2080), and long term (2071\textendash 2100) are analyzed, considering both the RCP 4.5 and RCP 8.5 scenarios. The results show a prevalently weak and not statistically significant climate signal for the RCP 4.5 scenario, while a more pronounced and significant signal is highlighted for the RCP 8.5 scenario in the medium and long term, indicating a decrease in wind producibility. Specifically, the conclusions suggest that future planning of wind producibility should mainly focus in some specific areas of the eastern Italian coast and in the south-east Italian regions, mostly in the off-shore areas. In these regions, indeed, the RCP 8.5 scenario shows the lowest decrease in the overall annual producibility, while, for the RCP 4.5 scenario, the medium and the long term foresee a slight increase in wind producibility at the annual level, while, in the short term, an increasing trend is observed mostly in the spring season. \textcopyright{} 2022, The Author(s).}

The traditional approach of climate risk analysis only considers local or point extreme value analysis and hence does not account for this spatially and temporally clustered exposure.

  abstract = {Corporations, industries and non-governmental organizations have become increasingly concerned with growing water risks in many parts of the world. Most of the focus has been on water scarcity and competition for the resource between agriculture, urban users, ecology and industry. However, water risks are multi-dimensional. Water-related hazards include flooding due to extreme rainfall, persistent drought and pollution, either due to industrial operations themselves, or to the failure of infrastructure. Most companies have risk management plans at each operational location to address these risks to a certain design level. The residual risk may or may not be managed, and is typically not quantified at a portfolio scale, i.e. across many sites. Given that climate is the driver of many of these extreme events, and there is evidence of quasi-periodic climate regimes at inter-annual and decadal timescales, it is possible that a portfolio is subject to persistent, multi-year exceedances of the design level. In other words, for a multi-national corporation, it is possible that there is correlation in the climate-induced portfolio water risk across its operational sites as multiple sites may experience a hazard beyond the design level in a given year. Therefore, from an investor's perspective, a need exists for a water risk index that allows for an exploration of the possible space and/or time clustering in exposure across many sites contained in a portfolio. This paper represents a first attempt to develop an index for financial exposure of a geographically diversified, global portfolio to the time-varying risk of climatic extremes using long daily global rainfall datasets derived from climate re-analysis models. Focusing on extreme daily rainfall amounts and using examples from major mining companies, we illustrate how the index can be developed. We discuss how companies can use it to explore their corporate exposure, and what they may need to disclose to investors and regulators to promote transparency as to risk exposure and mitigation efforts. For the examples of mining companies provided, we note that the actual exposure is substantially higher than would be expected in the absence of space and time correlation of risk as is usually tacitly assumed. We also find evidence for the increasing exposure to climate-induced risk, and for decadal variability in exposure. The relative vulnerability of different portfolios to multiple extreme events in a given year is also demonstrated.}

  abstract = {In a decarbonising world, the electricity generation mix in Australia's National Electricity Market (NEM) is likely to be heavily dependent on wind and solar. Designing an electricity system dominated by variable renewable energy generation requires careful examination of periods of low renewable output to ensure storage or other back up generation is sufficient to avoid loss of load. This study uses 15 years of climate and electricity demand data to examine the frequency and nature of the occurrence of low renewable periods. It examines strategies for their mitigation so that unserved energy standards are not breached. We have found that the winter period, May to August, is the time where the NEM is at greatest risk of loss of load. This winter period is when the demand in southern Australian states is higher, solar generation is lower and a series of low wind periods can drain storage. It has been demonstrated that any proposed generation mix reliant on renewable energy generation should be stress tested across a low wind winter, like the complex winter of 2010, not just a single isolated low wind period. Storage was found to be ideal to provide energy for a few hours overnight, but firm dispatchable thermal generation is likely to be a lower cost option than long term storage for extended low wind periods. Diversifying generation with the addition of offshore wind may reduce the need for storage, although the need for floating wind turbines may make this alternative too expensive to add any value in the Australian context.}

  abstract = {Planning and verification of hydraulic infrastructures require a design estimate of hydrologic variables, usually provided by frequency analysis, and neglecting hydrologic uncertainty. However, when hydrologic uncertainty is accounted for, the design flood value for a specific return period is no longer a unique value, but is represented by a distribution of values. As a consequence, the design flood is no longer univocally defined, making the design process undetermined. {$<$}br{$><$}br{$>$} The Uncertainty Compliant Design Flood Estimation (UNCODE) procedure is a novel approach that, starting from a range of possible design flood estimates obtained in uncertain conditions, converges to a single design value. This is obtained through a cost\textendash benefit criterion with additional constraints that is numerically solved in a simulation framework. This paper contributes to promoting a practical use of the UNCODE procedure without resorting to numerical computation. A modified procedure is proposed by using a correction coefficient that modifies the standard (i.e., uncertainty-free) design value on the basis of sample length and return period only. The procedure is robust and parsimonious, as it does not require additional parameters with respect to the traditional uncertainty-free analysis. {$<$}br{$><$}br{$>$} Simple equations to compute the correction term are provided for a number of probability distributions commonly used to represent the flood frequency curve. The UNCODE procedure, when coupled with this simple correction factor, provides a robust way to manage the hydrologic uncertainty and to go beyond the use of traditional safety factors. With all the other parameters being equal, an increase in the sample length reduces the correction factor, and thus the construction costs, while still keeping the same safety level.}

  abstract = {Modeling dependencies between climate extremes is important for climate risk assessment, for instance when allocating emergency management funds. In statistics, multivariate extreme value theory is often used to model spatial extremes. However, most commonly used approaches require strong assumptions and are either too simplistic or over-parameterized. From a machine learning perspective, generative adversarial networks (GANs) are a powerful tool to model dependencies in high-dimensional spaces. Yet in the standard setting, GANs do not well represent dependencies in the extremes. Here we combine GANs with extreme value theory (evtGAN) to model spatial dependencies in summer maxima of temperature and winter maxima in precipitation over a large part of western Europe. We use data from a stationary 2000-year climate model simulation to validate the approach and explore its sensitivity to small sample sizes. Our results show that evtGAN outperforms classical GANs and standard statistical approaches to model spatial extremes. Already with about 50 years of data, which corresponds to commonly available climate records, we obtain reasonably good performance. In general, dependencies between temperature extremes are better captured than dependencies between precipitation extremes due to the high spatial coherence in temperature fields. Our approach can be applied to other climate variables and can be used to emulate climate models when running very long simulations to determine dependencies in the extremes is deemed infeasible.}

  abstract = {The unprecedented tragedy of Hurricane Katrina produced unprecedented data for studying the impacts of natural disasters. The current paper looks at one public health outcome of this event: direct flood deaths in Orleans and St. Bernard parishes of Louisiana. In particular, the risk of death for the flood-exposed population is estimated, mapped, and discussed. Of the nearly 1,500 deaths that Louisiana officially counts as Katrina deaths, approximately 600 are determined to be associated with exposure to floodwaters. Additionally, it is estimated that approximately 63,000 persons were exposed to floodwaters. The ratio of flood deaths to flood-exposed population, termed the flood fatality rate, provides an empirical measure of flood risk. Georeferenced datasets on both the flood deaths and the flood-exposed population are developed, and then used to estimate and map the flood fatality rate. For the overall event, the flood fatality rate is estimated to be 7 11 deaths per 1,000 persons exposed, which is consistent with other coastal flood disasters. At the blockgroup level, the highest values of the flood fatality rate are observed in the Lower Ninth Ward, while comparatively lower values are observed in New Orleans East. A preliminary univariate regression model with water depth as the independent variable is presented, and applied to Hurricane Gustav, which impacted the region in August 2008.},

The HuRLO market allows investors to hedge against, or speculate on, the risk that a specific region in the Gulf of Mexico and on the East Coast of the United States will be the first to be hit by a hurricane. We simulate HuRLO market operations under various strategies used by risk-averse players using a formulation that accounts for the pari-mutuel price formation mechanism. We show that the order type, sequence, and order packaging significantly impact on the price paid, and on the number of traded options. We thus highlight that HuRLOs are difficult to evaluate and to purchase optimally, which limits the ability of the HuRLO market to act as an effective insurance mechanism. Potential improvements in the design of HuRLO contracts are suggested.},

From the recent economic recession to the health of financial markets, aging infrastructure, and a changing climate, complex issues threaten utilities' financial health. Many water utilities are responding to address these challenges. To date, few studies have examined how widespread innovative financial practices are among the nation's public water systems and how these practices are helping utilities cope with mounting financial challenges. This article examines the major financial challenges facing water utilities and reviews the current state of the US water sector's financial management practices with the aim of strengthening policymakers' understanding of the drivers and impacts of available financial mechanisms. Utility financial practices are evaluated on the basis of their ability to minimize risk and create financial resilience in utility financial management.}

  abstract = {A pilot-scale expanded target assessment of mixtures of inorganic and organic contaminants in point-of-consumption drinking water (tapwater, TW) was conducted in Puerto Rico (PR) to continue to inform TW exposures and corresponding estimations of cumulative human-health risks across the US. In August 2018, a spatial synoptic pilot assessment of than 524 organic and 37 inorganic chemicals was conducted in 14 locations (7 home; 7 commercial) across PR. A follow-up 3-day temporal assessment of TW variability was conducted in December 2018 at two of the synoptic locations (1 home, 1 commercial) and included daily pre- and post-flush samples. Concentrations of regulated and unregulated TW contaminants were used to calculate cumulative in vitro bioactivity ratios and Hazard Indices (HI) based on existing human-health benchmarks. Synoptic results confirmed that human exposures to inorganic and organic contaminant mixtures, which are rarely monitored together in drinking water at the point of consumption, occurred across PR and consisted of elevated concentrations of inorganic contaminants (e.g., lead, copper), disinfection byproducts (DBP), and to a lesser extent per/polyfluoroalkyl substances (PFAS) and phthalates. Exceedances of human-health benchmarks in every synoptic TW sample support further investigation of the potential cumulative risk to vulnerable populations in PR and emphasize the importance of continued broad characterization of drinking-water exposures at the tap with analytical capabilities that better represent the complexity of both inorganic and organic contaminant mixtures known to occur in ambient source waters. Such health-based monitoring data are essential to support public engagement in source water sustainability and treatment and to inform consumer point-of-use treatment decision making in PR and throughout the US.}

Each requires different strategies for operational implementation. Successful transition to routine use requires start-up investments in personnel time, training, computing, and other infrastructure. However, because comparable followon sensors are already planned (e.g. the NASA/NOAA VIIRS sensor aboard NPOESS), such investment can provide permanent enhancements to hydrological measurement and forecast capabilities. In regions where rivers and streams cross international boundaries, MODIS flood detection capabilities are especially useful: they provide consistent and independently verifiable information. However, even within relatively well-gauged regions, such as the U.S., the capability to characterise inundation as it occurs is an important and economical enhancement to flood warning and flood response.},

  abstract = {The northern Gulf of Mexico has been devastated by recent intense storms. Camille (1969) and Katrina (2005) are two notable hurricanes that made landfall in nearly the same location in Mississippi. Fully understanding the risks and processes associated with hurricane impacts are impeded by a short and fragmented instrumental record, however. Paleotempestology has the potential to employ modern analogues from intense storms in this region to extend the hurricane record beyond pre-observational time. Existing empirically-based models can back-calculate surge heights over coastal systems as a function of transport distance, particle settling velocity, and gravitational acceleration. We collected sediment cores in a pond (3) and adjacent beach (1) in Hancock County, Mississippi. Grain-size, loss-on-ignition, and microfossil analyses were conducted on cores in the context of a Bayesian statistical age model using 137Cs and 14C dating. Using Hurricane Camille to calibrate the archive, similar coarse-grained deposits were identified, and inverse sediment transport models calculated paleosurge intensities similar in magnitude to Camille over the 2500-yr record. Our multi-millennial annual average landfall probability (0.48\%) closely matches previously published studies from the Gulf of Mexico, indicating that intense hurricanes have not varied over these timescales. Over centennial timescales, active intervals occurred between 900 to 600 and 2200 to 1900yr BP, with relative quiescence between 1900 to 900yr BP. Comparisons with other published sites support the notion that southerly shifts in the Loop Current may be responsible for the decline in activity around 600yr BP.}

  abstract = {Abstract Tropical cyclones (TCs) are an important source of precipitation for much of the eastern United States. However, our understanding of the spatiotemporal variability of tropical cyclone precipitation (TCP) and the connections to large-scale atmospheric circulation is limited by irregularly distributed rain gauges and short records of satellite measurements. To address this, we developed a new gridded (0.25\textdegree{} \texttimes{} 0.25\textdegree ) publicly available dataset of TCP (1948\textendash 2015; Tropical Cyclone Precipitation Dataset, or TCPDat) using TC tracks to identify TCP within an existing gridded precipitation dataset. TCPDat was used to characterize total June\textendash November TCP and percentage contribution to total June\textendash November precipitation. TCP totals and contributions had maxima on the Louisiana, North Carolina, and Texas coasts, substantially decreasing farther inland at rates of approximately 6.2\textendash 6.7 mm km-1. Few statistically significant trends were discovered in either TCP totals or percentage contribution. TCP is positively related to an index of the position and strength of the western flank of the North Atlantic subtropical high (NASH), with the strongest correlations concentrated in the southeastern United States. Weaker inverse correlations between TCP and El Ni\~no\textendash Southern Oscillation are seen throughout the study site. Ultimately, spatial variations of TCP are more closely linked to variations in the NASH flank position or strength than to the ENSO index. The TCP dataset developed in this study is an important step in understanding hurricane\textendash climate interactions and the impacts of TCs on communities, water resources, and ecosystems in the eastern United States.},

Recently impovements have been made on the cost-benefit model introduced by van Dantzig after the devastating flood in the Netherlands in 1953. We consider the extension of this model to nonhomogeneous dike rings, which may also be applicable to other deltas in the world. A nonhomogeneous dike ring consists of different segments with different characteristics with respect to flooding and investment costs. The individual segments can be heightened independently at different moments in time and by different amounts, making the problem considerably more complex than the homogeneous case. We show how the problem can be modeled as a mixed-integer nonlinear programming problem, and we present an iterative algorithm that can be used to solve the problem. Moreover, we consider a robust optimization approach to deal with uncertainty in the model parameters. The method has been implemented and integrated in software, which is used by the government to determine how the safety standards in the Dutch Water Act should be changed.}

Yet, science-based and transparent solutions to assess and price climate physical risks are still missing. We provide an asset-level methodology that covers all the steps to compute how climate physical risks trans- late into economic and financial risks for investors. Asset-level shocks are computed conditional to the geolocation of firms' assets, such as productive plants, their exposure to both chronic and acute impacts (hurricanes), and across any chosen set of IPCC climate scenarios. We illustrate the methodology in an application to the equity portfolios of European investors that are exposed to listed firms owing productive plants located in Mexico. We show that using asset-level data, as opposed to aggregate firm data, can lead to over 53\% increase in estimated portfolio losses.}

  abstract = {Questions remain regarding how the skill of operational probabilistic forecasts is most usefully evaluated or compared, even though probability forecasts have been a long-standing aim in meteorological forecasting. This paper explains the importance of employing proper scores when selecting between the various measures of forecast skill. It is demonstrated that only proper scores provide internally consistent evaluations of probability forecasts, justifying the focus on proper scores independent of any attempt to influence the behavior of a forecaster. Another property of scores (i.e., locality) is discussed. Several scores are examined in this light. There is, effectively, only one proper, local score for probability forecasts of a continuous variable. It is also noted that operational needs of weather forecasts suggest that the current concept of a score may be too narrow; a possible generalization is motivated and discussed in the context of propriety and locality.}

  abstract = {The number of objectives in a multiobjective optimization problem strongly influences both the performance of generating methods and the decision making process in general. On the one hand, with more objectives, more incomparable solutions can arise, the number of which affects the generating method's performance. On the other hand, the more objectives are involved the more complex is the choice of an appropriate solution for a (human) decision maker. In this context, the question arises whether all objectives are actually necessary and whether some of the objectives may be omitted; this question in turn is closely linked to the fundamental issue of conflicting and non-conflicting optimization criteria. Besides a general definition of conflicts between objective sets, we here introduce the NP \textbackslash mathcal\{N\}\textbackslash mathcal\{P\} -hard problem of computing a minimum subset of objectives without losing information (MOSS). Furthermore, we present for MOSS both an approximation algorithm with optimum approximation ratio and an exact algorithm which works well for small input instances. We conclude with experimental results for a random problem and the multiobjective 0/1-knapsack problem.},

Specific configurations of impervious surfaces and land cover may be as important to determining a community's flood risk as baseline environmental conditions. This study addresses this issue by statistically examining the impacts of adjacent land use and land cover (LULC) on flood damage recorded on parcels within a coastal watershed in southeast Texas. We analyse empirical models to identify the influence of different LULCs surrounding over 7900 properties claiming insured flood losses from 1999\textendash 2009. Results indicate that specific types of surrounding LULCs impact observed flood losses and provide guidance on how neighbourhoods can be developed more resiliently over the long term.}

In response, this study conducts a parcel-level analysis of flood losses to identify the influence of specific location-based variables on property damage from multiple flood events. We statistically isolate the effect of multiple location-based characteristics on insured flood claims associated with two major coastal storms for over 7813 properties within the Clear Creek watershed southeast of Houston, Texas. Results indicate that location-based variables are among the strongest predictors for both, where seemingly subtle shifts in location add up to large dollar losses from flooding. These findings provide an increased understanding of the role of physical location within a flood-vulnerable region and how residential choice can be a major factor in exacerbating actual property loss.},

  abstract = {Federally-backed flood insurance is the primary mechanism by which residents in the United States (US) prepare for and recover from floods. While there is a growing literature on the general uptake of flood insurance, little work has been done to address the factors motivating residents to voluntarily buy and maintain federally-based insurance policies. We address this issue by conducting a survey of coastal residents in four localities in Texas and Florida. Based on survey responses, we quantitatively examine the factors influencing whether residents located outside of the 100-year floodplain obtain insurance policies when it is not required. Using two-samplet-tests and binary logistic regression analysis to control for multiple contextual and psychological variables, we statistically isolate the factors contributing most to the decision to purchase insurance. Our findings indicate that a resident located outside the 100-year floodplain who has voluntarily purchased federal flood insurance can be characterized, on average, as more highly educated, living in relatively expensive homes, and a long-time resident who thinks about flood hazard relatively infrequently but who, nonetheless, thinks flood insurance is relatively affordable. Unexpectedly, the physical proximity of a respondent to flood hazard areas makes little or no discernible difference in the decision to obtain flood insurance.}

The bad news is that even when optimized to the extent possible, in the long run, utilities will need more money in order to maintain their systems at the lowest life-cycle cost. Many regulatory agencies and customers will push back and insist that spending related to aging infrastructure be reasonably justified, but limiting a utility's ability to manage its aging equipment will eventually result in lower levels of reliability and higher rates in the future}

  abstract = {Current water infrastructure designs and design processes are ill-suited to address deep uncertainties related to climate variability and change. Water systems increasingly exhibit fragility to extreme weather events and changing climate conditions. The concept of resilience offers a framework to improve water system design for uncertain futures by incorporating capabilities such as persistence, adaptability and transformability. Existing formalizations of resilience in engineering design, however, are dependent on assumptions of climate and hydrologic stationarity and of well-characterized uncertainty, rendering them obsolete relative to our current understanding of the uncertainties we face. In this paper, we use methods based on decision making under deep uncertainty to establish a methodology to design for the resilience of water systems. The formulation generates water system design options that provide resilience capabilities at least cost and specify the optimal choices for persistence, adaptability and transformability for performance over a wide range of possible futures. As it was developed for application beyond water systems, the Resilience by Design is a generalizable approach offering important new methods of planning and managing for the resilience of critical infrastructure.}

  abstract = {Wind and solar electricity generation is projected to expand substantially over the next several decades due both to rapid cost declines as well as regulation designed to achieve climate targets. With increasing reliance on wind and solar generation, future energy systems may be vulnerable to previously underappreciated synoptic-scale variations characterized by low wind and/or surface solar radiation. Here we use western North America as a case study region to investigate the historical meteorology of weekly-scale ``droughts'' in potential wind power, potential solar power and their compound occurrence. We also investigate the covariability between wind and solar droughts with potential stresses on energy demand due to temperature deviations away human comfort levels. We find that wind power drought weeks tend to occur in late summer and are characterized by a mid-level atmospheric ridge centered over British Columbia and high sea level pressure on the lee side of the Rockies. Solar power drought weeks tend to occur near winter solstice when the seasonal minimum in incoming solar radiation co-occurs with the tendency for mid-level troughs and low pressure systems over the U.S. southwest. Compound wind and solar power drought weeks consist of the aforementioned synoptic pattern associated with wind droughts occurring near winter solstice when the solar resource is at its seasonal minimum. We find that wind drought weeks are associated with high solar power (and vice versa) both seasonally and in terms of synoptic meteorology, which supports the notion that wind and solar power generation can play complementary roles in a diversified energy portfolio at synoptic spatiotemporal scales over western North America.}

Residents of low-lying affordable housing, who tend to be low-income persons living in old and poor quality structures, are especially vulnerable. To elucidate the equity implications of sea level rise (SLR), we provide the first nationwide assessment of recent and future risks to affordable housing from SLR and coastal flooding in the United States. By using high-resolution building footprints and probability distributions for both local flood heights and SLR, we identify the coastal states and cities where affordable housing\textemdash both subsidized and market-driven\textemdash is most at risk of flooding. We provide estimates of both the expected number of affordable housing units exposed to extreme coastal water levels and of how often those units may be at risk of flooding. The number of affordable units exposed in the United States is projected to more than triple by 2050. New Jersey, New York, and Massachusetts have the largest number of units exposed to extreme water levels both in absolute terms and as a share of their affordable housing stock. Some top-ranked cities could experience numerous coastal floods reaching higher than affordable housing sites each year. As the top 20 cities account for 75\% of overall exposure, limited, strategic and city-level efforts may be able to address most of the challenge of preserving coastal-area affordable housing stock.}

Various pre-whitening and pre-coloring strategies have been proposed to make valid inference on standardised test statistics estimated by time series regression in this context of residually autocorrelated errors. Here we introduce a new method based on random permutation after orthogonal transformation of the observed time series to the wavelet domain. This scheme exploits the general whitening or decorrelating property of the discrete wavelet transform and is implemented using a Daubechies wavelet with four vanishing moments to ensure exchangeability of wavelet coefficients within each scale of decomposition. For -like or fractal noises, e.g., realisations of fractional Brownian motion (fBm) parameterised by Hurst exponent 0 {$<$} H {$<$} 1, this resampling algorithm exactly preserves wavelet-based estimates of the second order stochastic properties of the (possibly nonstationary) time series. Performance of the method is assessed empirically using -like noise simulated by multiple physical relaxation processes, and experimental fMRI data. Nominal type 1 error control in brain activation mapping is demonstrated by analysis of 13 images acquired under null or resting conditions. Compared to autoregressive pre-whitening methods for computational inference, a key advantage of wavelet resampling seems to be its robustness in activation mapping of experimental fMRI data acquired at 3 Tesla field strength. We conclude that wavelet resampling may be a generally useful method for inference on naturally complex time series. Hum.

The technique is referred to as the region of influence approach in that every site can have a potentially unique set of gauging stations for use in the estimation of at-site extremes. The rationale for the methodology is discussed, and several options for incorporating the approach into regional flood frequency analysis are developed and compared with traditional regional estimation procedures. Through a Monte Carlo experiment, the region of influence approach is demonstrated to provide improved at-site estimates of extreme flow quantlies in terms of network average root mean squared error and comparable results for bias. The method is further shown to have attractive features for estimating extremes for unusual sites in a network of gauging stations.}

  abstract = {The Texas freeze of February 2021 left more than 4.5 million customers (more than 10 million people) without electricity at its peak, some for several days. The freeze had cascading effects on other services reliant upon electricity including drinking water treatment and medical services. Economic losses from lost output and damage are estimated to be \$130 billion in Texas alone. In the wake of the freeze, there has been major fallout among regulators and utilities as actors sought to apportion blame and utilities and generators began to settle up accounts. This piece offers a retrospective on what caused the blackouts and the knock-on effects on other services, the subsequent financial and political effects of the freeze, and the implications for Texas and the country going forward. Texas failed to sufficiently winterize its electricity and gas systems after 2011. Feedback between failures in the two systems made the situation worse. Overall, the state faced outages of 30 GW of electricity as demand reached unprecedented highs. The gap between production and demand forced the non-profit grid manager, the Electric Reliability Council of Texas (ERCOT), to cut off supply to millions of customers or face a systems collapse that by some accounts was minutes away. The 2021 freeze suggests a need to rethink the state's regulatory approach to energy to avoid future such outcomes. Weatherization, demand response, and expanded interstate interconnections are potential solutions Texas should consider to avoid generation losses, reduce demand, and tap neighboring states' capacity.}

In this complex context, one of the major concerns is that related to the potentially catastrophic consequences of cascading failures triggered by rare and difficult to predict extreme weather events. In this work, we originally propose to combine an extreme weather stochastic model of literature to a realistic cascading failure simulator based on a direct current (DC) power flow approximation and a proportional re-dispatch strategy. The description of the dynamics of the network is completed by the introduction of a novel restoration model accounting for the operating conditions that a repair crew may encounter during an extreme weather event. The resulting model is solved by a customized sequential Monte Carlo scheme in order to quantify the impact of extreme weather events on the reliability/availability performances of the power grid. The approach is demonstrated with reference to the test case of the IEEE14 power transmission network.}

  abstract = {Coastal hazards often result from the combination of different simultaneous oceanographic processes that occur at multiple spatial and temporal scales. To predict coastal flooding and erosion, it is necessary to accurately represent hydrodynamic conditions. For this reason, here we present a stochastic, climate based wave emulator that provides the hydrodynamic conditions needed for these predictions. The emulator can generate an infinitely long data series maintaining its statistical properties at different time scales, from intra-storm to inter-annual variability, and its link to large scale climate patterns. The proposed methodology relies on the use of weather types and an autoregressive logistic regression model forced with different variables to simulate daily scale chronology. Considering the dependencies of wave conditions on the different weather types, the intra-storm chronology is solved by means of shuffling and stretching historical wave sequences. To demonstrate the replicability of this emulator worldwide, we have applied the model to 3 different locations and found good agreement when compared to the historical data. Furthermore, to illustrate and explain the strengths and limitations of the emulator, we present a different application for each of the different locations.}

  abstract = {Extreme sea levels are a significant threat to life, property, and the environment. These threats are managed by coastal planers through the implementation of risk mitigation strategies. Central to such strategies is knowledge of extreme event probabilities. Typically, these probabilities are estimated by fitting a suitable distribution to the observed extreme data. Estimates, however, are often uncertain due to the small number of extreme events in the tide gauge record and are only available at gauged locations. This restricts our ability to implement cost-effective mitigation. A remarkable fact about sea-level extremes is the existence of spatial dependences, yet the vast majority of studies to date have analyzed extremes on a site-by-site basis. Here we demonstrate that spatial dependences can be exploited to address the limitations posed by the spatiotemporal sparseness of the observational record. We achieve this by pooling all of the tide gauge data together through a Bayesian hierarchical model that describes how the distribution of surge extremes varies in time and space. Our approach has two highly desirable advantages: 1) it enables sharing of information across data sites, with a consequent drastic reduction in estimation uncertainty; 2) it permits interpolation of both the extreme values and the extreme distribution parameters at any arbitrary ungauged location. Using our model, we produce an observation-based probabilistic reanalysis of surge extremes covering the entire Atlantic and North Sea coasts of Europe for the period 1960\textendash 2013.},

  abstract = {Coastal communities across the world are already feeling the disastrous impacts of climate change through variations in extreme sea levels1. These variations reflect the combined effect of sea-level rise and changes in storm surge activity. Understanding the relative importance of these two factors in altering the likelihood of extreme events is crucial to the success of coastal adaptation measures. Existing analyses of tide gauge records2\textendash 10 agree that sea-level rise has been a considerable driver of trends in sea-level extremes since at least 1960. However, the contribution from changes in storminess remains unclear, owing to the difficulty of inferring this contribution from sparse data and the consequent inconclusive results that have accumulated in the literature11,12. Here we analyse tide gauge observations using spatial Bayesian methods13 to show that, contrary to current thought, trends in surge extremes~and sea-level rise both made comparable contributions to the overall change in extreme sea levels in Europe since 1960 . We determine that the trend pattern of surge extremes reflects the contributions from a dominant north\textendash south dipole associated with internal climate variability and a single-sign positive pattern related to anthropogenic forcing. Our results demonstrate that both external and internal influences can considerably affect the likelihood of surge extremes over periods as long as 60\,years, suggesting that the current coastal planning practice of assuming stationary surge extremes1,14 might be inadequate.},

  abstract = {The return level estimation is an essential topic in studying spatial extremes for environmental data. Recently, various models for spatial extremes have emerged, which generally yield different estimates for return levels, given the same data. In the meantime, several approaches that obtain confidence intervals (CIs) for return levels have arisen, and the results from different approaches can also largely disagree. These pose natural questions for assessing different return level estimation methods and different CI derivation approaches. In this article, we compare an array of popular models for spatial extremes in return level estimation, as well as three approaches in CI derivation, through extensive Monte Carlo simulations. Our results show that in general, max-stable models yield return level estimates with similar mean squared error, and the spatial generalized extreme value model also provides comparable estimates. The bootstrap method is recommended for max-stable models to compute the CI, and the profile likelihood CI works well for spatial generalized extreme value. We also evaluate the methods for return level interpolation at unknown spatial locations and find that kriging of marginal return level estimates performs as well as max-stable models.}

  abstract = {Abstract Globally available environmental observations (EOs), specifically from satellites and coupled earth systems models, represent some of the largest datasets of the digital age. As the volume of global EOs continues to grow, so does the potential of this data to help earth scientists discover trends and patterns in earth systems at large spatial scales. To leverage global EOs for scientific insight, earth scientists need targeted and accessible exposure to skills in reproducible scientific computing and spatiotemporal data science, and to be empowered to apply their domain understanding to interpret data-driven models for knowledge discovery. The GRRIEn (Generalizable, Reproducible, Robust, and Interpreted Environmental) analysis framework was developed to prepare earth scientists with an introductory statistics background and limited/no understanding of programming and computational methods to use global EOs to successfully generalize insights from local/regional field measurements across unsampled times and locations. GRRIEn analysis is generalizable, meaning results from a sample are translated to landscape scales by combining direct environmental measurements with global EOs using supervised machine learning; robust, meaning that model shows good performance on data with scale-dependent feature and observation dependence; reproducible, based on a standard repository structure so that other scientists can quickly and easily replicate the analysis with a few computational tools; and interpreted, meaning that earth scientists apply domain expertise to ensure that model parameters reflect a physically plausible diagnosis of the environmental system. This tutorial presents standard steps for achieving GRRIEn analysis by combining conventions of rigor in traditional experimental design with the open-science movement.},

  abstract = {In previous issues this journal has reported on the need for modernization of the electricity grid and investments in innovation and cleaner distributed energy technologies as critical components of a resilient grid, particularly as states and cities across the country are setting aggressive climate mitigation and decarbonization goals. With increasing frequency society is living through catastrophic weather events, including more frequent and damaging hurricanes and tornadoes, polar vortexes and widespread blizzards with subzero temperatures, forest fires followed by torrential rains and flooding, and record-setting heat indexes and drought. Natural gas and electric utilities work across the country to monitor weather closely and work hand-in-hand with weather forecasters, local Emergency Response Offices, be they state and/or municipal, preparing in advance for severe weather events. Utilities are adept and efficient at entering ``storm response mode'' \textendash{} to prepare the electricity grid and ensure utility crews are on hand and at the ready to restore power as quickly as possible to its customers. State and federal regulators require this, and if utilities fail in preparation or response, they can face significant penalties and fines and in some instances potentially lose their franchise operating license. While it is rare to lose a franchise, threats are often made by political leaders when frustrations boil over and constituents are completely frustrated with a utility's response.},

  abstract = {Hydropower plays a critical role in global, South American and Ecuadorian energy policy and for achieving Nationally Determined Contributions (NDCs) aiming to reduce greenhouse gas emissions. However, long-term climatic changes may affect the role of hydropower in meeting energy and climate policy objectives. The effects of climate change on runoff availability for hydropower generation are largely uncertain. This paper uses climate change scenarios derived from a large ensemble of Global Circulation Models as input for an energy system optimisation model (TIMES-EC) to examine least-cost options for the hydropower-dominated Ecuadorian power system in the period to 2050. This is done in the context of three policy cases in order to assess trade-offs between power system configuration, emissions and costs. The results show that in the long-term hydropower will remain as one of the most cost-effective and low emission technologies in the Ecuadorian power sector. However, constraints on deployment and uncertainty around climate change impacts could hinder its ability to contribute to the fulfilment of NDC targets, as well as create uncertainty around long-term power system costs. Strategies to hedge against these risks will likely require that hydropower expansion be complemented by alternative sources, namely incremental shares of thermoelectric generation with natural gas, biomass and geothermal energy.}

  abstract = {The occurrence of daily extreme precipitation events in southeast South America (S\~ao Paulo, Brazil) and the spatial features of convective activity in the South Atlantic convergence zone (SACZ) are investigated. Precipitation data from surface stations in S\~ao Paulo state from 1979 to 1996 are used to determine the frequency of occurrence of extremely heavy daily precipitation events. Daily averages of outgoing longwave radiation (OLR) are examined to characterize convective activity in the SACZ. OLR features are identified with factor analysis. Two factors explain 65\% of the total variance of the convective activity patterns in tropical South America and characterize events according to the intensity and extent of the OLR features over the Atlantic Ocean. The combination of factors indicates that 35\% of extreme precipitation events occurred when convective activity in the SACZ was intense over large parts of tropical South America, which includes S\~ao Paulo, but with less extent toward the Atlantic Ocean. Warm SST episodes (El Ni\~no) seem to modulate the occurrence of extremes associated with intense convection in the SACZ displaced northward of S\~ao Paulo and toward the Atlantic Ocean. The remaining events associated with weak convective activity in the SACZ suggest the role of transient systems producing extreme precipitation in S\~ao Paulo. The important contribution of the present work is the documentation of the role of orographic features for the regional distribution of extreme precipitation in S\~ao Paulo. It is shown that the regional distribution of extreme precipitation depends on both the intensity and form of the convection in the SACZ.}

  abstract = {The operation of large-scale water resources systems often involves several conflicting and noncommensurable objectives. The full characterization of tradeoffs among them is a necessary step to inform and support decisions in the absence of a unique optimal solution. In this context, the common approach is to consider many single objective problems, resulting from different combinations of the original problem objectives, each one solved using standard optimization methods based on mathematical programming. This scalarization process is computationally very demanding as it requires one optimization run for each trade-off and often results in very sparse and poorly informative representations of the Pareto frontier. More recently, bio-inspired methods have been applied to compute an approximation of the Pareto frontier in one single run. These methods allow to acceptably cover the full extent of the Pareto frontier with a reasonable computational effort. Yet, the quality of the policy obtained might be strongly dependent on the algorithm tuning and preconditioning. In this paper we propose a novel multiobjective Reinforcement Learning algorithm that combines the advantages of the above two approaches and alleviates some of their drawbacks. The proposed algorithm is an extension of fitted Q-iteration (FQI) that enables to learn the operating policies for all the linear combinations of preferences (weights) assigned to the objectives in a single training process. The key idea of multiobjective FQI (MOFQI) is to enlarge the continuous approximation of the value function, that is performed by single objective FQI over the state-decision space, also to the weight space. The approach is demonstrated on a real-world case study concerning the optimal operation of the HoaBinh reservoir on the Da river, Vietnam. MOFQI is compared with the reiterated use of FQI and a multiobjective parameterization-simulation-optimization (MOPSO) approach. Results show that MOFQI provides a continuous approximation of the Pareto front with comparable accuracy as the reiterated use of FQI. MOFQI outperforms MOPSO when no a priori knowledge on the operating policy shape is available, while produces slightly less accurate solutions when MOPSO can exploit such knowledge.},

Although many real-world applications have several conflicting objectives, reinforcement-learning (RL) literature has mainly focused on single-objective control problems. As a consequence, in the presence of multiple objectives, the usual approach is to consider many single-objective control problems (resulting from different combinations of the original problem objectives), each one solved using standard RL techniques. The algorithm proposed in this paper is an extension of Fitted Q-iteration (FQI) that enables to learn the control policies for all the linear combinations of preferences (weights) assigned to the objectives in a single training process. The key idea of multi-objective FQI (MOFQI) is to enlarge the continuous approximation of the action-value function, which is performed by single-objective FQI over the state-action space, also to the weight space. The approach is demonstrated on an interesting real-world application for multi-objective RL algorithms: the optimal operation of a multi-purpose water reservoir.}

  abstract = {The generalised extreme value (GEV) distribution is a three parameter family that describes the asymptotic behaviour of properly renormalised maxima of a sequence of independent and identically distributed random variables. If the shape parameter \$\textbackslash xi\$ is zero, the GEV distribution has unbounded support, whereas if \$\textbackslash xi\$ is positive, the limiting distribution is heavy-tailed with infinite upper endpoint but finite lower endpoint. In practical applications, we assume that the GEV family is a reasonable approximation for the distribution of maxima over blocks, and we fit it accordingly. This implies that GEV properties, such as finite lower endpoint in the case \$\textbackslash xi{$>$}0\$, are inherited by the finite-sample maxima, which might not have bounded support. This is particularly problematic when predicting extreme observations based on multiple and interacting covariates. To tackle this usually overlooked issue, we propose a blended GEV distribution, which smoothly combines the left tail of a Gumbel distribution (GEV with \$\textbackslash xi=0\$) with the right tail of a Fr\textbackslash 'echet distribution (GEV with \$\textbackslash xi{$>$}0\$) and, therefore, has unbounded support. Using a Bayesian framework, we reparametrise the GEV distribution to offer a more natural interpretation of the (possibly covariate-dependent) model parameters. Independent priors over the new location and spread parameters induce a joint prior distribution for the original location and scale parameters. We introduce the concept of property-preserving penalised complexity (P\$\^3\$C) priors and apply it to the shape parameter to preserve first and second moments. We illustrate our methods with an application to NO\$\_2\$ pollution levels in California, which reveals the robustness of the bGEV distribution, as well as the suitability of the new parametrisation and the P\$\^3\$C prior framework.},

State-of-the-art coastal risk models provide detailed regional information, but they can be difficult to implement, computationally challenging, and potentially inaccessible. Simple economic damage models are more accessible but may not incorporate important features and thus fail to model risks and trade offs with enough fidelity to support decision making. Here, we develop a new framework to analyze coastal flood risk management. The framework is computationally inexpensive yet incorporates common features of many coastal cities. We apply this framework to an idealized coastal city and assess and optimize two objectives using combinations of risk mitigation strategies against a wide range of future states of the world. We find that optimization using combinations of strategies allows for identification of Pareto optimal strategy combinations that outperform individual strategy options.}

  abstract = {Northern European sea levels show a non-stationary link to the North Atlantic Oscillation (NAO). The location of the centers of the NAO dipole, however, can be affected through the interplay with the East Atlantic (EAP) and the Scandinavian (SCAN) teleconnection patterns. Our results indicate the importance of accounting for the binary combination of the NAO with the EAP/SCAN for better understanding the non-stationary drivers inducing sea level variations along the European coasts. By combining altimetry and tide gauges, we find that anomalously high monthly sea levels along the Norwegian (North Sea) coast are predominantly governed by same positive phase NAO+/EAP+ (NAO+/SCAN+) type of atmospheric circulation, while the Newlyn and Brest tide gauges respond markedly to the opposite phase NAO-/EAP+ combination. Despite these regional differences, we find that coherent European sea level changes project onto a pattern resembling NAO+/SCAN+, which is signified by pressure anomalies over Scandinavia and southern Europe forcing winds to trace the continental slope, resulting in a pile-up of water along the European coasts through Ekman transport. We conclude that taking into consideration the interaction between these atmospheric circulation regimes is valuable and may help to understand the time-varying relationship between the NAO and European mean sea level.},

  abstract = {While environmental justice (EJ) research in the United States has focused primarily on the social distribution of chronic pollution risks, previous empirical studies have not analyzed disparities in exposure to both chronic (long-term) and acute (short-term) pollution in the same study area. Our article addresses this limitation though a case study that compares social inequities in exposure to chronic and acute pollution risks in the Greater Houston Metropolitan Statistical Area, Texas. The study integrates estimates of chronic cancer risk associated with ambient exposure to hazardous air pollutants from the Environmental Protection Agency's National-Scale Air Toxics Assessment (2005), hazardous chemical accidents from the National Response Center's Emergency Response Notification System (2007\textendash 2011), and sociodemographic characteristics from the American Community Survey (2007\textendash 2011). Statistical analyses are based on descriptive comparisons, bivariate correlations, and locally derived spatial regression models that account for spatial dependence in the data. Results indicate that neighborhoods with a higher percentage of Hispanic residents, lower percentage of homeowners, and higher income inequality are facing significantly greater exposure to both chronic and acute pollution risks. The non-Hispanic black percentage is significantly higher in neighborhoods with greater chronic cancer risk, but lower in areas exposed to acute pollution events. Households isolated by language\textemdash those highly likely to face evacuation problems during an actual chemical disaster\textemdash tend to reside in areas facing significantly greater exposure to high-impact acute events. Our findings emphasize the growing need to examine social inequities in exposure to both chronic and acute pollution risks in future EJ research and policy.},

  abstract = {Over the past decade, there has been appreciable progress towards modeling the water, energy, and carbon cycles at field scales (10\textendash 100 m) over continental to global extents in Earth system models (ESMs). One such approach, named HydroBlocks, accomplishes this task while maintaining computational efficiency via Hydrologic Response Units (HRUs), more commonly known as ``tiles'' in ESMs. In HydroBlocks, these HRUs are learned via a hierarchical clustering approach from available global high-resolution environmental data. However, until now there has yet to be a river routing approach that is able to leverage HydroBlocks' approach to modeling field-scale heterogeneity; bridging this gap will make it possible to more formally include riparian zone dynamics, irrigation from surface water, and interactive floodplains in the model. This paper introduces a novel dynamic river routing scheme in HydroBlocks that is intertwined with the modeled field-scale land surface heterogeneity. Each macroscale polygon (a generalization of the concept of macroscale grid cell) is assigned its own fine-scale river network that is derived from very high resolution ({$\sim$}30 m) digital elevation models (DEMs); the inlet\textendash outlet reaches of a domain's macroscale polygons are then linked to assemble a full domain's river network. The river dynamics are solved at the reach-level via the kinematic wave assumption of the Saint-Venant equations. Finally, a two-way coupling between each HRU and its corresponding fine-scale river reaches is established. To implement and test the novel approach, a 1.0\textsuperscript{{$\circ$}} bounding box surrounding the Atmospheric Radiation and Measurement (ARM) Southern Great Plains (SGP) site in northern Oklahoma (United States) is used. The results show (1) the implementation of the two-way coupling between the land surface and the river network leads to appreciable differences in the simulated spatial heterogeneity of the surface energy balance, (2) a limited number of HRUs ({$\sim$} 300 per 0.25\textsuperscript{{$\circ$}} cell) are required to approximate the fully distributed simulation adequately, and (3) the surface energy balance partitioning is sensitive to the river routing model parameters. The resulting routing scheme provides an effective and efficient path forward to enable a two-way coupling between the high-resolution river networks and state-of-the-art tiling schemes in ESMs.}

  abstract = {Climate models robustly imply that some significant change in precipitation patterns will occur. Models consistently project that the intensity of individual precipitation events increases by approximately 6\%\textendash 7\% K-1, following the increase in atmospheric water content, but that total precipitation increases by a lesser amount (1\%\textendash 2\% K-1 in the global average in transient runs). Some other aspect of precipitation events must then change to compensate for this difference. The authors develop a new methodology for identifying individual rainstorms and studying their physical characteristics\textemdash including starting location, intensity, spatial extent, duration, and trajectory\textemdash that allows identifying that compensating mechanism. This technique is applied to precipitation over the contiguous United States from both radar-based data products and high-resolution model runs simulating 80 years of business-as-usual warming. In the model study the dominant compensating mechanism is a reduction of storm size. In summer, rainstorms become more intense but smaller; in winter, rainstorm shrinkage still dominates, but storms also become less numerous and shorter duration. These results imply that flood impacts from climate change will be less severe than would be expected from changes in precipitation intensity alone. However, these projected changes are smaller than model\textendash observation biases, implying that the best means of incorporating them into impact assessments is via ``data-driven simulations'' that apply model-projected changes to observational data. The authors therefore develop a simulation algorithm that statistically describes model changes in precipitation characteristics and adjusts data accordingly, and they show that, especially for summertime precipitation, it outperforms simulation approaches that do not include spatial information.}

But can these methods help us devise robust strategies for managing environmental systems under great uncertainty? Here we explore how reinforcement learning, a subfield of artificial intelligence, approaches decision problems through a lens similar to adaptive environmental management: learning through experience to gradually improve decisions with updated knowledge. We review where reinforcement learning (RL) holds promise for improving evidence-informed adaptive management decisions even when classical optimization methods are intractable. For example, model-free deep RL might help identify quantitative decision strategies even when models are nonidentifiable. Finally, we discuss technical and social issues that arise when applying reinforcement learning to adaptive management problems in the environmental domain. Our synthesis suggests that environmental management and computer science can learn from one another about the practices, promises, and perils of experience-based decision-making.},

We introduce a data-driven framework that is based on analog forecasting (prediction using past similar patterns) and employs a novel deep learning pattern-recognition technique (capsule neural networks, CapsNets) and an impact-based autolabeling strategy. Using data from a large-ensemble fully coupled Earth system model, CapsNets are trained on midtropospheric large-scale circulation patterns (Z500) labeled 0\textendash 4 depending on the existence and geographical region of surface temperature extremes over North America several days ahead. The trained networks predict the occurrence/region of cold or heat waves, only using Z500, with accuracies (recalls) of 69\textendash 45\% (77\textendash 48\%) or 62\textendash 41\% (73\textendash 47\%) 1\textendash 5 days ahead. Using both surface temperature and Z500, accuracies (recalls) with CapsNets increase to 80\% (88\%). In both cases, CapsNets outperform simpler techniques such as convolutional neural networks and logistic regression, and their accuracy is least affected as the size of the training set is reduced. The results show the promises of multivariate data-driven frameworks for accurate and fast extreme weather predictions, which can potentially augment numerical weather prediction efforts in providing early warnings.}

However, because of the inherent complexities of such data, which are often spatio-temporal, chaotic, and non-stationary, the CNN algorithms must be designed/evaluated for each specific dataset and application. Yet CNN, being a supervised technique, requires a large labeled dataset to start. Labeling demands (human) expert time which, combined with the limited number of relevant examples in this area, can discourage using CNNs for new problems. To address these challenges, here we (1) Propose an effective auto-labeling strategy based on using an unsupervised clustering algorithm and evaluating the performance of CNNs in re-identifying and predicting these clusters up to 5 days ahead of time; (2) Use this approach to label thousands of daily large-scale weather patterns over North America in the outputs of a fully-coupled climate model and show the capabilities of CNNs in re-identifying and predicting the 4 clustered regimes up to 5 days ahead of time. The deep CNN trained with 1000 samples or more per cluster has an accuracy of 90\% or better for both identification and prediction while prediction accuracy scales weakly with the number of lead days. Accuracy scales monotonically but nonlinearly with the size of the training set, e.g. reaching 94\% with 3000 training samples per cluster for identification and 93\textendash 76\% for prediction at lead day 1\textendash 5, outperforming logistic regression, a simpler machine learning algorithm, by ~\textasciitilde ~25\%.

Here, we propose three components, inspired by physics, to integrate with commonly used DDWP models in order to improve their forecast accuracy. These components are (1) a deep spatial transformer added to the latent space of U-NET to capture rotation and scaling transformation in the latent space for spatiotemporal data, (2) a data-assimilation (DA) algorithm to ingest noisy observations and improve the initial conditions for next forecasts, and (3) a multi-time-step algorithm, which combines forecasts from DDWP models with different time steps through DA, improving the accuracy of forecasts at short intervals. To show the benefit and feasibility of each component, we use geopotential height at 500 hPa (Z500) from ERA5 reanalysis and examine the short-term forecast accuracy of specific setups of the DDWP framework. Results show that the spatial-transformer-based U-NET (U-STN) clearly outperforms the U-NET, e.g., improving the forecast skill by 45 \%. Using a sigma-point ensemble Kalman (SPEnKF) algorithm for DA and U-STN as the forward model, we show that stable, accurate DA cycles are achieved even with high observation noise. This DDWP+DA framework substantially benefits from large (\emph{O}(1000)) ensembles that are inexpensively generated with the data-driven forward model in each DA cycle. The multi-time-step DDWP+DA framework also shows promise; for example, it reduces the average error by factors of 2\textendash 3. These results show the benefits and feasibility of these three components, which are flexible and can be used in a variety of DDWP setups. Furthermore, while here we focus on weather forecasting, the three components can be readily adopted for other parts of the Earth system, such as ocean and land, for which there is a rapid growth of data and need for forecast and assimilation.{$<$}/p{$>$}}

  abstract = {Overestimation of precipitation frequency and duration while underestimating intensity, that is, the ``drizzling'' bias, has been a long-standing problem of global climate models. Here we explore this issue from the perspective of precipitation partitioning. We found that most models in the Climate Model Intercomparison Project Phase 5 (CMIP5) have high convective-to-total precipitation (PC/PR) ratios in low latitudes. Convective precipitation has higher frequency and longer duration but lower intensity than non-convective precipitation in many models. As a result, the high PC/PR ratio contributes to the ``drizzling'' bias over low latitudes. The PC/PR ratio and associated ``drizzling'' bias increase as model resolution coarsens from 0.5\textdegree{} to 2.0\textdegree, but the resolution's effect weakens as the grid spacing increases from 2.0\textdegree{} to 3.0\textdegree. Some of the CMIP6 models show reduced ``drizzling'' bias associated with decreased PC/PR ratio. Thus, more reasonable precipitation partitioning, along with finer model resolution should alleviate the ``drizzling'' bias within current climate models.}

Current infrastructure design is primarily based on precipitation Intensity-Duration-Frequency (IDF) curves with the so-called stationary assumption, meaning extremes will not vary significantly over time. However, climate change is expected to alter climatic extremes, a concept termed nonstationarity. Here we show that given nonstationarity, current IDF curves can substantially underestimate precipitation extremes and thus, they may not be suitable for infrastructure design in a changing climate. We show that a stationary climate assumption may lead to underestimation of extreme precipitation by as much as 60\%, which increases the flood risk and failure risk in infrastructure systems. We then present a generalized framework for estimating nonstationary IDF curves and their uncertainties using Bayesian inference. The methodology can potentially be integrated in future design concepts.},

  abstract = {Zimbabwe's catastrophic cholera outbreak of 2008\textendash 9 saw an unprecedented number of people affected, with 100,000 cases and nearly 5,000 deaths. Cholera, however, was much more than a public health crisis: it represented the nadir of the country's deepening political and economic crisis of 2008. This study focuses on the political life of the cholera epidemic, tracing the historical origins of the outbreak, examining the social pattern of its unfolding and impact, analysing the institutional and communal responses to the disease, and marking the effects of its aftermath. Across different social and institutional settings, competing interpretations and experiences of the cholera epidemic created charged social and political debates. In his examination of these debates which surrounded the breakdown of Zimbabwe's public health infrastructure and failing bureaucratic order, the scope and limitations of disaster relief, and the country's profound levels of livelihood poverty and social inequality, Simukai Chigudu reveals how this epidemic of a preventable disease had profound implications for political institutions and citizenship in Zimbabwe.},

  abstract = {The Greater Mekong Subregion is a transnational area bound together by the Mekong River basin and its immense hydropower resources, historically seen as the backbone of regional economic development. The basin is now punctuated by several dams, successful in attracting both international investors and fierce criticisms for their environmental and societal impacts. Surprisingly, no attention has been paid so far to the actual performance of these infrastructures: is hydropower supply robust with respect to the hydroclimatic variability characterizing Southeast Asia? When water availability is altered, what are the implications for power production costs and CO2 emissions? To answer these questions, we focus on the Laotian\textendash Thai grid\textemdash the first international power-trade infrastructure developed in the region\textemdash and use a power system model driven by a spatially distributed hydrological-water management model. Simulation results over a 30-year period show that production costs and carbon footprint are significantly affected by droughts, which reduce hydropower availability and increase reliance on thermoelectric resources. Regional droughts across the Mekong basin are of particular concern, as they reduce the export of cheap hydropower from Laos to Thailand. To put the analysis into a broader climate-water-energy context, we show that the El Ni\~no Southern Oscillation modulates not only the summer monsoon, but also the power system behavior, shaping the relationship between hydroclimatological conditions, power production costs, and CO2 emissions. Overall, our results and models provide a knowledge basis for informing robust management strategies at the water-energy scale and designing more sustainable power plans in the Greater Mekong Subregion.},

  abstract = {Coastal areas are particularly vulnerable to flooding from heavy rainfall, sea storm surge, or a combination of the two. Recent studies project higher intensity and frequency of heavy rains, and progressive sea level rise continuing over the next decades. Pre-emptive and optimal flood defense policies that adaptively address climate change are needed. However, future climate projections have significant uncertainty due to multiple factors: (a) future CO2 emission scenarios; (b) uncertainties in climate modelling; (c) discount factor changes due to market fluctuations; (d) uncertain migration and population growth dynamics. Here, a methodology is proposed to identify the optimal design and timing of flood defense structures in which uncertainties in 21st century climate projections are explicitly considered probabilistically. A multi-objective optimization model is developed to minimize both the cost of the flood defence infrastructure system and the flooding hydraulic risk expressed by Expected Annual Damage (EAD). The decision variables of the multi-objective optimization problem are the size of defence system and the timing of implementation. The model accounts for the joint probability density functions of extreme rainfall, storm surge and sea level rise, as well as the damages, which are determined dynamically by the defence system state considering the probability and consequences of system failure, using a water depth\textendash damage curve related to the land use (Corine Land Cover); water depth due to flooding are calculated by hydraulic model. A new dominant sorting genetic algorithm (NSGAII) is used to solve the multi-objective problem optimization. A case study is presented for the Pontina Plain (Lazio Italy), a coastal region, originally a swamp reclaimed about a hundred years ago, that is rich in urban centers and farms. A set of optimal adaptation policies, quantifying size and timing of flood defence constructions for different climate scenarios and belonging to the Pareto curve obtained by the NSGAII are identified for such a case study to mitigate the risk of flooding and to aid decision makers.},

  abstract = {In the context of climate change and variability, there is considerable interest in how large scale climate indicators influence regional precipitation occurrence and its seasonality. Seasonal and longer climate projections from coupled ocean\textendash atmosphere models need to be downscaled to regional levels for hydrologic applications, and the identification of appropriate state variables from such models that can best inform this process is also of direct interest. Here, a Non-Homogeneous Hidden Markov Model (NHMM) for downscaling daily rainfall is developed for the Agro-Pontino Plain, a coastal reclamation region very vulnerable to changes of hydrological cycle. The NHMM, through a set of atmospheric predictors, provides the link between large scale meteorological features and local rainfall patterns. Atmospheric data from the NCEP/NCAR archive and 56-years record (1951\textendash 2004) of daily rainfall measurements from 7 stations in Agro-Pontino Plain are analyzed. A number of validation tests are carried out, in order to: 1) identify the best set of atmospheric predictors to model local rainfall; 2) evaluate the model performance to capture realistically relevant rainfall attributes as the inter-annual and seasonal variability, as well as average and extreme rainfall patterns. Validation tests show that the best set of atmospheric predictors are the following: mean sea level pressure, temperature at 1000 hPa, meridional and zonal wind at 850 hPa and precipitable water, from 20\textdegree N to 80\textdegree N of latitude and from 80\textdegree W to 60\textdegree E of longitude. Furthermore, the validation tests show that the rainfall attributes are simulated realistically and accurately. The capability of the NHMM to be used as a forecasting tool to quantify changes of rainfall patterns forced by alteration of atmospheric circulation under climate change and variability scenarios is discussed.},

The following atmospheric fields, temperature at 1000 hPa, geo-potential height at 1000 hPa, meridional winds and zonal winds at 850 hPa, and zonal winds at the equator from 10 to 1000 hPa, in a region defined by 25\textdegree S\textendash 25\textdegree N and 25\textdegree\textendash 75\textdegree E are identified as appropriate predictors for the downscaling of the seasonal regime of daily rainfall in Tanzania.

Instead of pre-specifying a fixed rainy season, the model considers seasonality of precipitation to be determined by the 21st century simulations of the atmospheric variables used as predictors. The future downscaled precipitation simulations for the RCP8.5 scenario indicate that in the 21st century Tanzania may experience: (1) a slight decrease in the number of wet days and seasonal rainfall in MAM and JJAS, but not in OND; (2) a reduction of annual total rainfall; and (3) an intensification of the frequency and intensity of extreme rainfall, as identified by 90th, 95th, and 99th percentiles.},

  abstract = {Flood risk management decisions in many countries are based on decision-support frameworks which rely on cost-benefit analyses. Such frameworks are seldom informative about the geographical distribution of risk, raising questions on the fairness of the proposed policies. In the present work, we propose a new decision criterion that accounts for the distribution of risk reduction and apply it to support flood risk management decisions on a transboundary stretch of the Rhine River. Three types of interventions are considered: embankment heightening, making Room for the River, and changing the discharge distribution of the river branches. The analysis involves solving a flood risk management problem according to four alternative formulations, based on different ethical principles. Formulations based on cost optimization lead to very poor performances in some areas for the sake of reducing the overall aggregated costs. Formulations that also include equity criteria have different results depending on how these are defined. When risk reduction is distributed equally, very poor economic performance is achieved. When risk is distributed equally, results are in line with formulations based on cost optimization, while a fairer risk distribution is achieved. Risk reduction measures also differ, with the cost optimization approach strongly favoring the leverage of changing the discharge distribution and the alternative formulations spending more on embankment heightening and Room for the River, to rebalance inequalities in risk levels. The proposed method advances risk-based decision-making by allowing to consider risk distribution aspects and their impacts on the choice of risk reduction measures.},

  abstract = {Rivers typically flow through multiple flood-protected areas which are clearly interconnected, as risk reduction measures taken at one area, e.g., heightening dikes or building flood storage areas, affect risk elsewhere. We call these interconnections `hydraulic interactions'. The current approach to flood risk management, however, neglects hydraulic interactions for two reasons: They are uncertain and, furthermore, considering them would require the design of policies not only striving for risk reduction, but also accounting for risk transfers across flood-protected areas. In the present paper, we compare the performance of policies identified according to the current approach with those of two alternative formulations: One acknowledging hydraulic interactions and the other also including an additional decision criterion to account for equity in risk distribution across flood-protected areas. Optimal policies are first identified under deterministic hydraulic interactions, and, next, they are stress-tested under uncertainty. We found that the current approach leads to a false sense of equal risk distribution. It does, however, perform efficiently when a risk-averse approach towards uncertain hydraulic interactions is taken. Accounting for hydraulic interactions in the design of policies, instead, increases efficiency and both efficiency and equity when hydraulic interactions are considered deterministically and as uncertain, respectively.},

  abstract = {Global growth in variable renewable generation has brought significant attention to the challenge of balancing electricity supply and demand. However, inter-annual variability of energy resources has only recently begun to feature in energy system assessments and receives limited recognition in policy discussion, let~alone policy design. Meteorological reanalysis datasets that blend modern modelling techniques with historic weather records are seeing increased application in energy system studies. This practice offers insights for market and policy design implications as governments seek to manage the changing energy landscape, as seen with the UK's introduction of the Electricity Market Reform policy package. Here we apply a concise, Load Duration Curve based approach to consider the market and policy implications of increasing variability in the Great Britain (GB) energy system. Our findings emphasise the growing inter-annual variability in operating opportunity for residual mid-merit and even baseload generation, alongside implications for capacity assurance approaches. The growth in wind generation is seen to bring an accompanying opportunity for increased solar generation, with its lower inter-annual variability and largely uncorrelated annual characteristic. The results underscore the need for an increased recognition of inter-annual variability when addressing market design and incentive mechanisms.}

As in the extremal analysis of any environmental process, estimates often are required of the probability of events that are rarer than those already recorded. As data on extremes are scarce, all available sources of information should be used in inference. Consequently, research has focused on the development of techniques that make optimal use of available data. In this paper a daily rainfall series is analysed within a Bayesian framework, illustrating how the careful elicitation of prior expert information can supplement data and lead to improved estimates of extremal behaviour. For example, using the prior knowledge of an expert hydrologist, a Bayesian 95\% interval estimate of the 100-year return level for daily rainfall is found to be approximately half of the width of the corresponding likelihood-based confidence interval.},

  abstract = {Floods are the leading cause of natural disaster damages in the United States, with billions of dollars incurred every year in the form of government payouts, property damages, and agricultural losses. The Federal Emergency Management Agency oversees the delineation of floodplains to mitigate damages, but disparities exist between locations designated as high risk and where flood damages occur due to land use and climate changes and incomplete floodplain mapping. We harnessed publicly available geospatial datasets and random forest algorithms to analyze the spatial distribution and underlying drivers of flood damage probability (FDP) caused by excessive rainfall and overflowing water bodies across the conterminous United States. From this, we produced the first spatially complete map of FDP for the nation, along with spatially explicit standard errors for four selected cities. We trained models using the locations of historical reported flood damage events (n = 71 434) and a suite of geospatial predictors (e.g. flood severity, climate, socio-economic exposure, topographic variables, soil properties, and hydrologic characteristics). We developed independent models for each hydrologic unit code level 2 watershed and generated a FDP for each 100 m pixel. Our model classified damage or no damage with an average area under the curve accuracy of 0.75; however, model performance varied by environmental conditions, with certain land cover classes (e.g. forest) resulting in higher error rates than others (e.g. wetlands). Our results identified FDP hotspots across multiple spatial and regional scales, with high probabilities common in both inland and coastal regions. The highest flood damage probabilities tended to be in areas of low elevation, in close proximity to streams, with extreme precipitation, and with high urban road density. Given rapid environmental changes, our study demonstrates an efficient approach for updating FDP estimates across the nation.}

  abstract = {Environmental justice research on flooding has relied heavily on analyses of aggregated geographic areal units and assessing exposure to `pre-flood' risks (e.g., residence in 100-year flood zones) rather than actual flood events. To address these limitations, we examined disproportionate exposure to flooding caused by Hurricane Harvey in 2017 in Greater Houston (Texas). Using primary survey data collected from 377 representative households before Harvey and spatial data on Harvey-induced inundation developed by the US Federal Emergency Management Agency, we found that the areal extent of flooding around residents' home sites was distributed inequitably with respect to race/ethnicity and socioeconomic status (SES). Hispanic, black and other racial/ethnic minority households experienced more extensive flooding than white households, and lower SES households faced more extensive flooding than higher SES households. Findings align with prior flood risk research in Greater Houston and provide cause for concern, as social inequities in flood exposure may have influenced social disparities in flood impacts and post-disaster needs. Since flood events in Greater Houston are expected to increase in frequency and magnitude due to climate change, socially disparate impacts are likely to become an increasingly salient public policy issue. Thus, proactive approaches for reducing flood risks and ameliorating disparities should be implemented.}

There is a growing body of analysis on the impacts of wind and solar variability on power system operation. Existing studies tend to use a single or typical year of generation data, which overlooks the substantial year-to-year fluctuation in weather, or to only consider variation in the meteorological inputs, which overlooks the complex response of an interconnected power system. Here, we address these gaps by combining detailed continent-wide modeling of Europe's future power system with 30 years of historical weather data. The most representative single years are 1989 and 2012, but using multiple years reveals a 5-fold increase in Europe's inter-annual variability of CO2 emissions and total generation costs from 2015 to 2030. We also find that several metrics generalize to linear functions of variable renewable penetration: CO2 emissions, curtailment of renewables, wholesale prices, and total system costs.}

Here, we first contribute an updated framework for review, classification, and analysis of the literature on the determinants of household water consumption. Our framework allows trade-off analysis of different criteria that account for the representation of a potential water consumption determinant in the literature, its impact across heterogeneous case studies, and the effort required to collect information on it. We then review a comprehensive set of 48 publications with our proposed framework. The results of our trade-off analysis show that distinct groups of determinants exist, allowing for the formulation of recommendations for practitioners and researchers on which determinants to consider in practice and prioritize in future research.},

The dataset of historical tailings dam failures is updated from the one used by Rico et al., (Floods from tailings dam failures, Journal of Hazardous Materials, 154 (1) (2008) 79\textendash 87) for their regression model. It includes events out of the range of the dams contained in the previous dataset. A new linear regression model for the calculation of Dmax, which considers the potential energy associated with the released volume is proposed. A reduction in the uncertainty in the estimation of Dmax when large tailings dam failures are evaluated, is demonstrated. Since site conditions vary significantly it is important to directly consider the uncertainty associated with such predictions, rather than directly using these types of regression equations. Here, we formally quantify the uncertainty distribution for the conditional estimation of VF and Dmax, given tailings dam attributes, and advocate its use to better represent the tailings dam failure data and to characterize the risk associated with a potential failure.},

And when companies have access to sophisticated modeling about future impacts\textemdash{} some of them potentially devastating for entire communities\textemdash the decision to share that information has been largely left up to the corporation.This Article argues that actionable and transparent information about our climate-changed future is a public good that the private sector cannot be depended upon to provide equitably or reliably. Further, all private climate services rely on upstream climate data and models that were collected and produced by an enormous network of public institutions. There are important lessons to be learned from the recent success of special interests in pressing for the privatization of weather data and services\textemdash a trend that has knock-on effects for weather forecasts globally. This Article urges state and federal governments to invest in their own climate services capacity at a scale not currently contemplated. Risk assessments lacking a scientific basis can lead to maladaptation across the economy. While it is a potentially limited matter of consumer protection or tort liability when a consultancy over-promises its analytical capabilities, it is a much larger problem if regulators themselves misunderstand the limits of uncertainty when designing risk oversight.}

This Article seeks to explain how this mispricing can exist at the level of individual assets drawing from scholarship on corporate governance and the mechanisms of market (in)efficiency. Market actors: 1. Lack the fine-grained asset-level data they need in order to assess risk exposure; 2.  Continue to rely on outdated means of assessing risk; 3. Have misaligned incentives resulting in climate-specific agency costs; 4. Have myopic biases exacerbated by climate change misinformation; and 5. Are impeded by captured regulators distorting the market. Further, trends in institutional share ownership reinforce apathy regarding assessment of firm-specific fundamentals, especially over long-term horizons. This underpricing of corporate climate risk contributes to the negative effects of climate change itself, as the mispricing of risk in the present leads to a misallocation of investment capital, hindering future adaptation and subsidizing future fossil combustion. These risks could accumulate to the macroeconomic scale, generating a systemic risk to the financial system. While a broad array of government interventions are necessary to mitigate climate related financial risks, this Article focuses on proposals for corporate governance and securities regulation\textemdash and their limits. Signals from the Biden Administration suggest that mandatory climate risk disclosure regulation from the Securities and Exchange Commission is forthcoming. This Article argues that climate risk disclosure is necessary, though alone not sufficient, to address the widespread disregard of corporate climate exposure.}

  abstract = {River floods cause extensive losses to economy, ecology and society throughout the world. They are driven by the space-time structure of catchment rainfall, which is determined by large-scale, or even global-scale, atmospheric processes. The identification of coherent, large-scale atmospheric circulation structures that determine the moisture transport and convergence associated with rainfall induced flooding can help improve its predictability and phenomenology. In this paper, we extend a methodology, used for the analysis of extreme rainfall events, to high streamflow events (HSEs). The approach combines multiple machine learning methods to link HSEs to atmospheric circulation patterns. An application to the German streamflow network using reanalysis data for the period 1960 to 2012 is presented. Daily streamflow from 166 gauges, homogeneously distributed across Germany, are used. Geopotential height fields and integrated vapor transport (IVT) are derived from reanalysis data. An unsupervised neural network, Self Organizing Maps, is applied to geopotential height to identify a finite number of circulation patterns (CPs). Event synchronization between CPs and HSEs is used to establish if they are linked or not. If they are linked, the Event Synchronization method computes the delay between the occurrence of a CP and a HSE. Finally, local logistic regression is used to estimate the probability of occurrence of a HSE, as function of CP and IVT. We demonstrate that our approach is very effective to evaluate HSE probability occurrence across Germany.},

The modeling choices used for updating lead to large uncertainties; however, it is unclear how much these uncertainties affect the design and cost of stormwater systems. This study investigates how the choice of spatial resolution of the regional climate model (RCM) ensemble and the spatial adjustment technique affect climate-corrected IDF curves and resulting stormwater infrastructure designs in 34 US cities for the period 2020 to 2099. In most cities, IDF values are significantly different between three spatial adjustment techniques and two RCM spatial resolutions. These differences have the potential to alter the size of stormwater systems designed using these choices and affect the results of climate impact modeling more broadly. The largest change in the engineering decision results when the design storm is selected from the upper bounds of the uncertainty distribution of the IDF curve, which changes the stormwater pipe design size by five increments in some cases, nearly doubling the cost. State and local agencies can help reduce some of this variability by setting guidelines, such as avoiding the use of the upper bound of the future uncertainty range as a design storm and instead accounting for uncertainty by tracking infrastructure performance over time and preparing for adaptation using a resilience plan.}

Separate hierarchical models are constructed for the intensity and the frequency of extreme precipitation events. For intensity, we model daily precipitation above a high threshold at 56 weather stations with the generalized Pareto distribution. For frequency, we model the number of exceedances at the stations as binomial random variables. Both models assume that the regional extreme precipitation is driven by a latent spatial process characterized by geographical and climatological covariates. Effects not fully described by the covariates are captured by spatial structure in the hierarchies. Spatial methods were improved by working in a space with climatological coordinates. Inference is provided by a Markov chain Monte Carlo algorithm and spatial interpolation method, which provide a natural method for estimating uncertainty.}

For this purpose, we develop a Bayesian hierarchical model. Since extreme value analyses typically only use data considered to be extreme, the hierarchical approach is particularly useful as it sensibly pools the limited data from neighboring locations. We simultaneously model the data from both a control and future run of the RCM which allows for easy inference about projected change. Additionally, this hierarchical model is the first to spatially model the shape parameter which characterizes the nature of the distribution's tail. Our hierarchical model shows that for the winter season, the RCM indicates a general increase in 100-year precipitation return levels for most of the study region. For the summer season, the RCM surprisingly indicates a significant decrease in the 100-year precipitation return level.}

As a result, flood-risk estimates can diverge, leading to different conclusions for decision-making. Using examples of household-scale fluvial (riverine) flood-risk information in the United States, we assess design features and risk communication approaches that may lead to more actionable information for decision-making. We argue that increased attention to uncertainty characterization and model diagnostics is a critical intermediate step for developing simpler approaches for designing flood-risk information. Simpler frameworks are desirable because flood risks change over time, and simpler frameworks are less costly to update. Developing frameworks for large spatial domains require collaboration grounded in principles of open science. Finally, systematically evaluating how decision-makers access and use information can provide new insights to guide risk communication and information design.}

  abstract = {Why do some communities have access to essential services, such as water or health care, and neighboring communities do not? How do citizens influence the distribution of public services? This dissertation presents a theory of "trading favors" in which I argue that communities can coordinate and trade their collective votes for preferential access to public services. This long-term relationship with politicians is a form of local distributive politics, and I highlight that neighborhood associations provide a platform for voters to organize and increase their bargaining power towards politicians. I argue that 1) high community activity and 2) strong, unified leadership can enable group members to coordinate their votes before an election and get the attention of politicians after the election to improve their access to public services. I focus on variation in water access: water scarcity is a growing global concern, and access to water is often manipulated as a political tool.        During 18 months of fieldwork, I collected extensive qualitative and quantitative evidence from the state of Cear\'a in Northeast Brazil. I include a historical discussion of the origins of community organizing and introduce a typology of community organizing. I illustrate the theoretical mechanisms through case studies of neighboring communities that draw on 104 qualitative interviews with rural residents, local leaders, state bureaucrats, and academic experts. I test my main hypotheses through statistical analysis of an original household survey with 1,990 respondents from 120 rural communities merged with precinct-level electoral data. I also analyze long-term voting patterns at over 15,000 electoral precincts across Cear\'a in five municipal elections.        I find that water access is most reliable and secure in communities with high community activity, strong social ties, and constant leadership. I find evidence for my main mechanism: organized communities are more likely to concentrate their votes, and bloc voting improves water access. Communities are very consistent in their bloc voting behavior over time: the same places continue to concentrate their votes, and the same places continue to disperse their votes. I also find evidence that many communities switch allegiance across elections, which indicates that communities are credible in their threats to switch their electoral support if they do not get the services they need.        My findings shed light on the important but poorly understood influence of collective action on local politics and development. The distributive politics literature tends to focus on decision-making by parties and politicians. My results demonstrate the agency of voters in organizing collectively to select and influence candidates that make distributive appeals, especially through neighborhood associations. I develop our understanding of local leaders, who often serve as development/vote brokers and intermediate access to the state, and I provide evidence that poor citizens bargain with their votes and can use bloc voting as a grassroots strategy for improving public service access.},

Gaussian Processes (GPs) are a powerful tool for modeling time series, but so far there are no competitive approaches for automatic forecasting based on GPs. We propose practical solutions to two problems: automatic selection of the optimal kernel and reliable estimation of the hyperparameters. We propose a fixed composition of kernels, which contains the components needed to model most time series: linear trend, periodic patterns, and other flexible kernel for modeling the non-linear trend. Not all components are necessary to model each time series; during training the unnecessary components are automatically made irrelevant via automatic relevance determination (ARD). We moreover assign priors to the hyperparameters, in order to keep the inference within a plausible range; we design such priors through an empirical Bayes approach. We present results on many time series of different types; our GP model is more accurate than state-of-the-art time series models. Thanks to the priors, a single restart is enough the estimate the hyperparameters; hence the model is also fast to train.},

To date, empirical assessments of damage trends have been inconclusive. Our study demonstrates a temporal increase in extreme damages, after controlling for a number of factors. We analyze event-level data using quantile regressions to capture patterns in the damage distribution (not just its mean) and find strong evidence of progressive rightward skewing and tail-fattening over time. While the effect of time on averages is hard to detect, effects on extreme damages are large, statistically significant, and growing with increasing percentiles. Our results are consistent with an upwardly curved, convex damage function, which is commonly assumed in climate-economics models. They are also robust to different specifications of control variables and time range considered and indicate that the risk of extreme damages has increased more in temperate areas than in tropical ones. We use simulations to show that underreporting bias in the data does not weaken our inferences; in fact, it may make them overly conservative.},

For example, synoptic meteorological conditions can produce considerable rainfall-runoff, while also generating wind-driven elevated sea-levels. When these drivers interact in space and time, they can exacerbate flood impacts, a phenomenon known as compound flooding. In this paper, we build a Bayesian Network based on Gaussian copulas to generate the equivalent of 500 years of daily stochastic boundary conditions for a coastal watershed in Southeast Texas. In doing so, we overcome many of the limitations of conventional univariate approaches and are able to probabilistically represent compound floods caused by riverine and coastal interactions. We model the resulting water levels using a one-dimensional (1D) steady-state hydraulic model and find that flood stages in the catchment are strongly affected by backwater effects from tributary inflows and downstream water levels. By comparing our results against a bathtub modeling approach, we show that simplifying the multivariate dependence between flood drivers can lead to an underestimation of flood impacts, highlighting that accounting for multivariate dependence is critical for the accurate representation of flood risk in coastal catchments prone to compound events.},

  abstract = {{$<$}p{$><$}strong{$>$}Abstract.{$<$}/strong{$>$} The interaction between physical drivers from oceanographic, hydrological, and meteorological processes in coastal areas can result in compound flooding. Compound flood events, like Cyclone Idai and Hurricane Harvey, have revealed the devastating consequences of the co-occurrence of coastal and river floods. A number of studies have recently investigated the likelihood of compound flooding at the continental scale based on simulated variables of flood drivers, such as storm surge, precipitation, and river discharges. At the global scale, this has only been performed based on observations, thereby excluding a large extent of the global coastline. The purpose of this study is to fill this gap and identify regions with a high compound flooding potential from river discharge and storm surge extremes in river mouths globally. To do so, we use daily time series of river discharge and storm surge from state-of-the-art global models driven with consistent meteorological forcing from reanalysis datasets. We measure the compound flood potential by analysing both variables with respect to their timing, joint statistical dependence, and joint return period. Our analysis indicates many regions that deviate from statistical independence and could not be identified in previous global studies based on observations alone, such as Madagascar, northern Morocco, Vietnam, and Taiwan. We report possible causal mechanisms for the observed spatial patterns based on existing literature. Finally, we provide preliminary insights on the implications of the bivariate dependence behaviour on the flood hazard characterisation using Madagascar as a case study. Our global and local analyses show that the dependence structure between flood drivers can be complex and can significantly impact the joint probability of discharge and storm surge extremes. These emphasise the need to refine global flood risk assessments and emergency planning to account for these potential interactions.{$<$}/p{$>$}}

  abstract = {Power system planning aims at ensuring that sufficient supply- and demand-side assets exist to meet electricity demand at all times. For a Texas electric power system with high wind and solar penetrations, we quantify how climate change will affect supply and demand during three types of high stress periods for the power grid: high demand hours, high net demand hours, and high system ramp hours. We specifically quantify effects on demand, reductions in available thermal capacity (i.e. thermal deratings), wind and solar generation, and net demand. We estimate each using meteorological variables from five climate change projections (2041\textendash 2050) assuming Representative Concentration Pathway 8.5 and from a reference period (1996\textendash 2005). All five projections indicate that climate change will increase demand by up to 2 GWh during high demand hours (4\% of demand in the reference period) and increase net demand by up to 3 GWh during high net demand periods (6\% of net demand in the reference period). All five projections also indicate thermal deratings will increase during high demand and net demand periods by up to 2 GWh and high net demand ramps will increase by up to 2 GW. Overall, our results indicate compounding effects of climate change in Texas will necessitate greater investment in peak and flexible capacity.}

Energy system modeling faces a transformation: accounting for changing meteorological conditions imposed by climate change. To enable that transformation, a community of practice in energy-climate modeling has started to form that aims to better integrate energy system models with weather and climate models. Here, we evaluate the disconnects between the energy system and climate modeling communities, then lay out a research agenda to bridge those disconnects. In the near-term, we propose interdisciplinary activities for expediting uptake of future climate data in energy system modeling. In the long-term, we propose a transdisciplinary approach to enable development of (1) energy-system-tailored climate datasets for historical and future meteorological conditions and (2) energy system models that can effectively leverage those datasets. This agenda increases the odds of meeting ambitious climate mitigation goals by systematically capturing and mitigating climate risk in energy sector decision-making.}

  abstract = {Climate change might impact various components of the bulk electric power system, including electricity demand; transmission; and thermal, hydropower, wind, and solar generators. Most research in this area quantifies impacts on one or a few components and does not link these impacts to effects on power system planning and operations. Here, we advance the understanding of how climate change might impact the bulk U.S. power system in three ways. First, we synthesize recent research to capture likely component-level impacts of climate change in the United States. Second, given the interconnected nature of the electric power system, we assess how aggregated component-level impacts might affect power system planning and operations. Third, we outline an agenda for future research on climate change impacts on power system planning and operations. Although component-level impacts vary in their magnitude, collectively they might significantly affect planning and operations. Most notably, increased demand plus reduced firm capacity across generation types might require systems to procure significant additional capacity to maintain planning reserve margins, and regional declines in renewable resources might need to be offset by increasing zero-carbon investment to meet decarbonization targets. Aggregated impacts might also affect operations, e.g., through shifts in dispatching and increased operational reserve requirements. Future research should aggregate component-level impacts at operational timescales, quantify impacts on wind and solar variability, and contextualize climate change impacts within ongoing shifts in the electric power system.}

  abstract = {It is often assumed that, as a consequence of global warming, a reduction of snow load on the ground should be expected. In reality, snow load is often depending on local orographic situations that can determine an increase of its height, even when the average snow height over the surrounding areas is reduced. Large snow loads on roofs during the winter season of 2005\textendash 2006 led to over 200 roof collapses in Central Europe. To proceed with the adaptation of the European standards for important buildings and infrastructures to the implications of climate change, the expected changes in the climatic loading shall be assessed in terms of the Eurocodes concept for characteristic values of variable climatic actions. The paper presents a procedure for derivation of snow load on ground from data on daily temperatures and precipitation. In addition, it allows to derive the characteristic snow loads from climate change projections and thus to evaluate the future trends in variation of snow loading. Analysis of these trends for the Italian territory is performed by comparing the results for several subsequent time periods of thirty years, with those obtained for the reference period 1951\textendash 1980. Results presented show a significant increase in the snow loading for the period 1981\textendash 2010 in many regions in north and east Italy in comparison with the reference period. It is suggested that a European project on snow load map shall be started, in order to help National Competent Authorities to redraft the national snow load maps for design with the Eurocodes.}

ABC can be a powerful tool to make inferences with complex models if these principles are carefully applied.}

  abstract = {Public acquisitions of floodplain properties, or ``buyouts,'' whereby governments purchase properties at risk of flooding from willing sellers and convert them to open space, are a widely used strategy for reducing risk. Since 1990, the U.S. Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) has provided funding for more than 40,000 properties. Yet, little is known about the costs of buyout implementation, even though federal funding requirements mandate a complex set of activities undertaken by local, state, and federal government staff. This lack of understanding of buyout activity costs hinders development of evidence-based policy recommendations. To address this gap, we surveyed local and state government officials and consultants who have worked on floodplain buyout projects. Our survey results provide the first systematic, activity-level financial documentation of buyout projects in the U.S. Local and state government respondents reported median per-property activity costs of \$14,428 and \$8,161 (or 9.64\% and 6.95\% of property purchase costs), respectively. Respondents also reported significant variation in the activities undertaken as part of each project; community engagement strategies were particularly diverse, suggesting some households may not be adequately informed as a result of insufficient funding, time, or technical capacity for these activities. The varied and complex structures of buyout projects, as well as the attendant activity costs, pose barriers to implementation for local governments. Our results suggest both that: a) additional support and flexibility may be needed for critical activities that improve the experience of buyout participants; and b) reducing other activity costs may produce significant savings, which in turn could be used to improve the quality and expand the scope of buyout projects.}

  abstract = {The 2017 Texas Water Development Board's State Water Plan predicts a 41\% gap between water demand and existing supply by 2070. This reflects an overall projection, but the challenge will affect various regions of the state differently. Texas has 16 regional water planning zones characterized by distinct populations, water demands, and existing water supplies. Each is expected to face variations of pressures, such as increased agricultural and energy development (particularly hydraulic fracturing) and urban growth that do not necessarily follow the region's water plan. Great variability in resource distribution and competing resource demands across Texas will result in the emergence of distinct hotspots, each with unique characteristics that require multiple, localized, interventions to bridge the statewide water gap. This study explores three such hotspots: 1) water-food competition in Lubbock and the potential of producing 3\,billion\,gallons of treated municipal waste water and encouraging dryland agriculture; 2) implementing Low Impact Developments (LIDs) for agriculture in the City of San Antonio, potentially adding 47\,billion\,gallons of water supply, but carrying a potentially high financial cost; and 3) water-energy interrelations in the Eagle Ford Shale in light of well counts, climate dynamics, and population growth. The growing water gap is a state wide problem that requires holistic assessments that capture the impact on the tightly interconnected water, energy, and food systems. Better understanding the trade-offs associated with each `solution' and enabling informed dialogue between stakeholders, offers a basis for formulating localized policy recommendations specific to each hotspot.}

Existing literature has developed coastal fragility models for bridges. However, to date, flood fragility models for coastal roadways are lacking. For this purpose, the current study proposes a data-driven fragility model based on logistic regression for coastal roadways, with failure probability conditioned on distance to shoreline and inundation duration, using hindcast data for Hurricane Ike. In addition, the effect of bridge and roadway damage on transportation network performance is investigated through a case study on Galveston Island, Texas. The results indicate the spatial distribution of storm impacts on the transportation network, with select roads highly vulnerable if they are located within a couple of hundred meters of the shoreline. In addition, considering roadway damage in addition to bridge damage alone, which is the current state of the art, can have a significant impact on decreasing the performance of the transportation network. Such analyses shed light on potential policy or risk mitigation practices that are expected to be increasingly important in the future as sea level rise further reduces roadway distance to the shoreline or as storm intensity and frequency changes.},

  abstract = {Wood poles are among key components of the overhead grid infrastructure that are highly vulnerable to wind hazards. In coastal regions where hurricanes are often accompanied with a storm surge, in addition to high wind pressure, poles may experience significant surge and wave loads with the potential of triggering multiple failure mechanisms. However, multihazard pole fragility models that consider various modes of failure are lacking. This paper proposed a set of parameterized fragility models that are a function of wind-, surge-, and wave-related intensity measures and properties of poles. For this purpose, a design of experiment was conducted to generate realizations of intensity measures and pole-specific deterministic and uncertain parameters. For each realization, the state of survival/failure of pole was estimated for each mode of failure. Subsequently, for each class of pole and soil type, a logistic regression was carried out to generate fragility models for pole rupture at the ground line and pole overturning due to foundation failure. The results indicated that both pole rupture and foundation failure can be significant modes of failure conditioned on the type of soil. For example, for medium-strength cohesive soils, both modes of failure were significant, whereas for very-stiff-strength cohesive soils, pole rupture was the dominant mode of failure. The results of this study are key for risk and resilience analysis of coastal electric power systems and provide useful insights for decision making and risk management processes.},

This article develops a class of highly scalable nearest-neighbor Gaussian process (NNGP) models to provide fully model-based inference for large geostatistical datasets. We establish that the NNGP is a well-defined spatial process providing legitimate finite-dimensional Gaussian densities with sparse precision matrices. We embed the NNGP as a sparsity-inducing prior within a rich hierarchical modeling framework and outline how computationally efficient Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) algorithms can be executed without storing or decomposing large matrices. The floating point operations (flops) per iteration of this algorithm is linear in the number of spatial locations, thereby rendering substantial scalability. We illustrate the computational and inferential benefits of the NNGP over competing methods using simulation studies and also analyze forest biomass from a massive U.S. Forest Inventory dataset at a scale that precludes alternative dimension-reducing methods.

  abstract = {Precipitation extremes have increased across many regions of the United States, with further increases anticipated in response to additional global warming. Quantifying the impact of these precipitation changes on flood damages is necessary to estimate the costs of climate change. However, there is little empirical evidence linking changes in precipitation to the historically observed increase in flood losses. We use {$>$}6,600 reports of state-level flood damage to quantify the historical relationship between precipitation and flood damages in the United States. Our results show a significant, positive effect of both monthly and 5-d state-level precipitation on state-level flood damages. In addition, we find that historical precipitation changes have contributed approximately one-third of cumulative flood damages over 1988 to 2017 (primary estimate 36\%; 95\% CI 20 to 46\%), with the cumulative impact of precipitation change totaling \$73 billion (95\% CI 39 to \$91 billion). Further, climate models show that anthropogenic climate forcing has increased the probability of exceeding precipitation thresholds at the extremely wet quantiles that are responsible for most flood damages. Climate models project continued intensification of wet conditions over the next three decades, although a trajectory consistent with UN Paris Agreement goals significantly curbs that intensification. Taken together, our results quantify the contribution of precipitation trends to recent increases in flood damages, advance estimates of the costs associated with historical greenhouse gas emissions, and provide further evidence that lower levels of future warming are very likely to reduce financial losses relative to the current global warming trajectory.},

  abstract = {Abstract The semipermanent subtropical anticyclone over the North Atlantic basin (the ``Azores high'') has a major influence on the weather and climate of much of North America, western Europe, and northwestern Africa. The authors develop a climatology of the Azores high by examining its spatial and temporal changes since 1899. Using gridded surface pressure values, anticyclones are identified when the daily pressure is {$\geq$}1020 mb and frequencies are tabulated for each half month from 1899 to 1990. Principal components analysis is applied to analyze the anticyclone's spatial variance structure. The Azores high is dominated by two spatial modes: a summer pattern, in which high pressure dominates the Atlantic basin, and a winter pattern, in which anticyclones are present over eastern North America and northwestern Africa. Century-long declines in these two modes indicate that there has been a net removal of atmospheric mass over the subtropical Atlantic. Other modes include a meridional versus zonal circulation pattern and omega blocks. Time series of the mean annual principal component scores indicate that meridional flow has been increasing over the Atlantic and that blocking anticyclones have become more prevalent over west-central Europe and less common over the northeastern Atlantic and the British Isles.},

  abstract = {Net emissions of CO2 by human activities\textemdash including not only energy services and industrial production but also land use and agriculture\textemdash must approach zero in order to stabilize global mean temperature. Energy services such as light-duty transportation, heating, cooling, and lighting may be relatively straightforward to decarbonize by electrifying and generating electricity from variable renewable energy sources (such as wind and solar) and dispatchable (``on-demand'') nonrenewable sources (including nuclear energy and fossil fuels with carbon capture and storage). However, other energy services essential to modern civilization entail emissions that are likely to be more difficult to fully eliminate. These difficult-to-decarbonize energy services include aviation, long-distance transport, and shipping; production of carbon-intensive structural materials such as steel and cement; and provision of a reliable electricity supply that meets varying demand. Moreover, demand for such services and products is projected to increase substantially over this century. The long-lived infrastructure built today, for better or worse, will shape the future.Here, we review the special challenges associated with an energy system that does not add any CO2 to the atmosphere (a net-zero emissions energy system). We discuss prominent technological opportunities and barriers for eliminating and/or managing emissions related to the difficult-to-decarbonize services; pitfalls in which near-term actions may make it more difficult or costly to achieve the net-zero emissions goal; and critical areas for research, development, demonstration, and deployment. It may take decades to research, develop, and deploy these new technologies. ADVANCESA successful transition to a future net-zero emissions energy system is likely to depend on vast amounts of inexpensive, emissions-free electricity; mechanisms to quickly and cheaply balance large and uncertain time-varying differences between demand and electricity generation; electrified substitutes for most fuel-using devices; alternative materials and manufacturing processes for structural materials; and carbon-neutral fuels for the parts of the economy that are not easily electrified. Recycling and removal of carbon from the atmosphere (carbon management) is also likely to be an important activity of any net-zero emissions energy system. The specific technologies that will be favored in future marketplaces are largely uncertain, but only a finite number of technology choices exist today for each functional role. To take appropriate actions in the near term, it is imperative to clearly identify desired end points. To achieve a robust, reliable, and affordable net-zero emissions energy system later this century, efforts to research, develop, demonstrate, and deploy those candidate technologies must start now. OUTLOOKCombinations of known technologies could eliminate emissions related to all essential energy services and processes, but substantial increases in costs are an immediate barrier to avoiding emissions in each category. In some cases, innovation and deployment can be expected to reduce costs and create new options. More rapid changes may depend on coordinating operations across energy and industry sectors, which could help boost utilization rates of capital-intensive assets, but this will require overcoming institutional and organizational challenges in order to create new markets and ensure cooperation among regulators and disparate, risk-averse businesses. Two parallel and broad streams of research and development could prove useful: research in technologies and approaches that can decarbonize provision of the most difficult-to-decarbonize energy services, and research in systems integration that would allow reliable and cost-effective provision of these services. {$<$}img class="fragment-image" aria-describedby="F1-caption" src="https://science.sciencemag.org/content/sci/360/6396/eaas9793/F1.medium.gif"/{$>$} Download high-res image Open in new tab Download Powerpoint A shower of molten metal in a steel foundry.Industrial processes such as steelmaking will be particularly challenging to decarbonize. Meeting future demand for such difficult-to-decarbonize energy services and industrial products without adding CO2 to the atmosphere may depend on technological cost reductions via research and innovation, as well as coordinated deployment and integration of operations across currently discrete energy industries. Some energy services and industrial processes\textemdash such as long-distance freight transport, air travel, highly reliable electricity, and steel and cement manufacturing\textemdash are particularly difficult to provide without adding carbon dioxide (CO2) to the atmosphere. Rapidly growing demand for these services, combined with long lead times for technology development and long lifetimes of energy infrastructure, make decarbonization of these services both essential and urgent. We examine barriers and opportunities associated with these difficult-to-decarbonize services and processes, including possible technological solutions and research and development priorities. A range of existing technologies could meet future demands for these services and processes without net addition of CO2 to the atmosphere, but their use may depend on a combination of cost reductions via research and innovation, as well as coordinated deployment and integration of operations across currently discrete energy industries.}

Although many studies have assessed net-zero emissions pathways, the common features and tradeoffs of energy systems across global scenarios at the point of net-zero CO2 emissions have not yet been evaluated. Here, we examine the energy systems of 177 net-zero scenarios and discuss their long-term technological and regional characteristics in the context of current energy policies. We find that, on average, renewable energy sources account for 60\% of primary energy at net-zero (compared to {$\sim$}14\% today), with slightly less than half of that renewable energy derived from biomass. Meanwhile, electricity makes up approximately half of final energy consumed (compared to {$\sim$}20\% today), highlighting the extent to which solid, liquid, and gaseous fuels remain prevalent in the scenarios even when emissions reach net-zero. Finally, residual emissions and offsetting negative emissions are not evenly distributed across world regions, which may have important implications for negotiations on burden-sharing, human development, and equity.},

  abstract = {Climate models predict Africa will warm by up to 5\textdegree C in the coming century, stressing African societies. To provide independent constraints on model predictions, this study compares two notable reconstructions of East African temperatures to those predicted by Paleoclimate Model Intercomparison Project (PMIP3) and transient TraCE (Transient Climate Evolution) simulations, focusing on the Mid-Holocene (MH, 5\textendash 8 kyr B.P.). Reconstructions of tropical African temperature derived from lake sedimentary archives indicate 1\textendash 2.5\textdegree C of warming during the MH relative to the 20th century, but most climate models do not replicate the warming observed in these paleoclimate data. We investigate this discrepancy using a new lake proxy system model, with attention to the (potentially non-stationary) relationship between lake temperature and air temperature. We find amplified lake surface temperature changes compared to air temperature during the MH due to heightened seasonality and precessional forcing. Lacustrine processes account for some of the warming, and highlight how the lake heat budget leads to a rectification of the seasonal cycle; however, the simulated lake heating bias is insufficient to reconcile the full discrepancy between the models and the proxy-derived MH warming. We find further evidence of changes in mixing depth over time, potentially driven by changes in cloud cover and shortwave radiative fluxes penetrating the lake surface. This may confound interpretation for glycerol dialkyl glycerol tetraethers (GDGT) compounds which exist in the mixed layer, and suggests a need for independent constraints on mixed layer depth. This work provides a new interpretive framework for invaluable paleoclimate records of temperature changes over the African continent.}

Characterizing teleconnection changes to improve prediction requires many realizations of ENSO events, but twentieth century data are temporally limited. To extend twentieth century records, we evaluate ENSO events in a new last-millennium paleoclimate data assimilation reconstruction to deduce how mean state changes affect the magnitude/extent of ENSO-driven rainfall in the United States. Despite global cooling during the Little Ice Age, the central-eastern tropical Pacific warms relative to the Medieval Climate Anomaly, shifting teleconnections eastward and increasing rainfall anomalies in the southwestern United States. Teleconnections strengthen independently of ENSO amplitude; we thus suggest caution in using paleoclimate reconstructions of teleconnection rainfall as a proxy for ENSO amplitude. We demonstrate teleconnection rainfall is sensitive to the pattern of tropical Pacific mean SST changes, underscoring the importance of reducing uncertainties in future warming patterns in the tropical Pacific.}

This study examines projected future trends of multiple measures of extreme heat across Texas throughout the next century, and evaluates the expected climate changes alongside Texas athletic staff (coach and athletic trainer) attitudes toward heat and climate change. Numerical climate simulations from the recently published Community Earth System Model version 2 and the Climate Model Intercomparison Project were used to predict changes in summer temperatures, heat indices, and wet bulb temperatures across Texas and also within specific metropolitan areas. A survey examining attitudes toward the effects of climate change on athletic programs and student athlete health was also distributed to high-school and university athletic staff. Heat indices are projected to increase beyond what is considered healthy/safe limits for outdoor sports activity by the mid-to-late 21st century. Survey results reveal a general understanding and acceptance of climate change and a need for adjustments in accordance with more dangerous heat-related events. However, a portion of athletic staff still do not acknowledge the changing climate and its implications for student athlete health and their athletic programs. Enhancing climate change and health communication across the state may initiate important changes to athletic programs (e.g., timing, duration, intensity, and location of practices), which should be made in accordance with increasingly dangerous temperatures and weather conditions. This work employs a novel interdisciplinary approach to evaluate future heat projections alongside attitudes from athletic communities toward climate change.}

However, these predictions remain uncertain, in particular, for precipitation (Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change, 2013, https://doi.org/10.1017/CBO9781107415324.004). Held and Soden (2006, https://doi.org/10.1175/JCLI3990.1) suggest that as lower tropospheric water vapor concentration increases in a warming climate, the atmospheric circulation and convective mass fluxes will weaken. Unfortunately, this process is difficult to constrain, as convective mass fluxes are poorly observed and incompletely simulated in GCMs. Here we demonstrate that stable hydrogen isotope ratios in tropical atmospheric water vapor can trace changes in temperature, atmospheric circulation, and convective mass flux in a warming world. We evaluate changes in temperature, the distribution of water vapor, vertical velocity ({$\omega$}), advection, and water isotopes in vapor ({$\delta$}DV). Using water isotope-enabled GCM experiments for modern versus high-CO2 atmospheres, we identify spatial patterns of circulation change over the tropical Pacific. We find that slowing circulation in the tropical Pacific moistens the lower troposphere and weakens convective mass flux, both of which impact the {$\delta$}D of water vapor in the midtroposphere. Our findings constitute a critical demonstration of how water isotope ratios in the tropical Pacific respond to changes in radiative forcing and atmospheric warming. Moreover, as changes in {$\delta$}DV can be observed by satellites, our results develop new metrics for the detection of global warming impacts to the hydrological cycle and, specifically, the strength of the Walker circulation.}

  abstract = {Reconstructions of temperature and hydrology from lake sedimentary archives have made fundamental contributions to our understanding of past, present, and future climate and help evaluate general circulation models (GCMs). However, because paleoclimate observations are an indirect (proxy) constraint on climatic variables, confounding effects of proxy processes complicate interpretations of these archives. To circumvent these uncertainties inherent to paleoclimate data-model comparison, proxy system models (PSMs) provide transfer functions between climate variables and the proxy. We here present a new PSM for lacustrine sedimentary archives. The model simulates lake energy and water balance, sensors including leaf wax {$\delta$}D and carbonate {$\delta$}18O, bioturbation, and compaction of sediment to lend insight toward how these processes affect and potentially obfuscate the original climate signal. The final product integrates existing and new models to yield a comprehensive, modular, adaptable, and publicly available PSM for lake systems. Highlighting applications of the PSM, we forward model lake variables with GCM simulations of the last glacial maximum and the modern. The simulations are evaluated with a focus on sensitivity of lake surface temperature and mixing to climate forcing, using Lakes Tanganyika and Malawi as case studies. The PSM highlights the importance of mixing on interpretations of air temperature reconstructions from lake archives and demonstrates how changes in mixing depth alone may induce nonstationarity between in situ lake and air temperatures. By placing GCM output in the same reference frame as lake paleoclimate archives, we aim to improve interpretations of past changes in terrestrial temperatures and water cycling.}

  abstract = {Shallow water coral reefs and deep sea coral communities are sensitive to current and future environmental stresses, such as changes in sea surface temperatures (SST), salinity, carbonate chemistry, and acidity. Over the last half-century, some reef communities have been disappearing at an alarming pace. This study focuses on the Gulf of Mexico, where the majority of shallow coral reefs are reported to be in poor or fair condition. We analyze the RCP8.5 ensemble of the Community Earth System Model v1.2 to identify monthly-to-decadal trends in Gulf of Mexico SST. Secondly, we examine projected changes in ocean pH, carbonate saturation state, and salinity in the same coupled model simulations. We find that the joint impacts of predicted higher temperatures and changes in ocean acidification will severely degrade Gulf of Mexico reef systems by the end of the twenty-first century. SSTs are likely to warm by 2.5\textendash 3\textdegree C; while corals do show signs of an ability to adapt toward higher temperatures, current coral species and reef systems are likely to suffer major bleaching events in coming years. We contextualize future changes with ancient reefs from paleoclimate analogs, periods of Earth's past that were also exceptionally warm, specifically rapid ``hyperthermal'' events. Ancient analog events are often associated with extinctions, reef collapse, and significant ecological changes, yet reef communities managed to survive these events on evolutionary timescales. Finally, we review research which discusses the adaptive potential of the Gulf of Mexico's coral reefs, meccas of biodiversity and oceanic health. We assert that the only guaranteed solution for long-term conservation and recovery is substantial, rapid reduction of anthropogenic greenhouse gas emissions.}

  abstract = {The spectral characteristics of paleoclimate observations spanning the last millennium suggest the presence of significant low-frequency (multi-decadal to centennial scale) variability in the climate system. Since this low-frequency climate variability is critical for climate predictions on societally-relevant scales, it is essential to establish whether General Circulation models (GCMs) are able to simulate it faithfully. Recent studies find large discrepancies between models and paleoclimate data at low frequencies, prompting concerns surrounding the ability of GCMs to predict long-term, high-magnitude variability under greenhouse forcing (Laepple and Huybers, 2014a, 2014b). However, efforts to ground climate model simulations directly in paleoclimate observations are impeded by fundamental differences between models and the proxy data: proxy systems often record a multivariate and/or nonlinear response to climate, precluding a direct comparison to GCM output. In this paper we bridge this gap via a forward proxy modeling approach, coupled to an isotope-enabled GCM. This allows us to disentangle the various contributions to signals embedded in ice cores, speleothem calcite, coral aragonite, tree-ring width, and tree-ring cellulose. The paper addresses the following questions: (1) do forward-modeled ``pseudoproxies'' exhibit variability comparable to proxy data? (2) if not, which processes alter the shape of the spectrum of simulated climate variability, and are these processes broadly distinguishable from climate? We apply our method to representative case studies, and broaden these insights with an analysis of the PAGES2k database (PAGES2K Consortium, 2013). We find that current proxy system models (PSMs) can help resolve model-data discrepancies on interannual to decadal timescales, but cannot account for the mismatch in variance on multi-decadal to centennial timescales. We conclude that, specific to this set of PSMs and isotope-enabled model, the paleoclimate record may exhibit larger low-frequency variability than GCMs currently simulate, indicative of incomplete physics and/or forcings.}

  abstract = {The tropical response to explosive volcanism remains underconstrained in the paleoclimate record. While the atmosphere cools due to aerosol forcing following volcanic eruptions, modeling evidence suggests that the tropical Pacific responds with compensatory warming. Given the rarity of large volcanic eruptions and the short instrumental record, these modeling results require independent verification. Here, we test for links between volcanism and tropical Pacific dynamics using the newly developed Paleo Hydrodynamics Data Assimilation product (PHYDA), which spans the past 2,000 years. Using Pacific sea surface temperature fields from PHYDA and coincident volcanic eruptions, we test the response of the El Ni\~no\textendash Southern Oscillation (ENSO) to large, tropical volcanic eruptions. We identify a weak El Ni\~no-like response of the tropical Pacific in the year following sufficiently large, tropical volcanic eruptions. While the response is not significant at the 95\% confidence level using superposed epoch analysis (SEA) and self-organizing maps, a significant result does emerge when employing probability density functions. Our results indicate that the widely used SEA approach, based on composite averaging, may not be sufficiently sensitive to capture an ENSO response in the presence of large internal variability. We additionally conclude that inconsistencies in both the spatial patterns and magnitudes between climate models and PHYDA results indicate that current models overestimate the regional tropical response to volcanic forcing.}

To date, this approach yields very uncertain results, due to the difficulties of global and regional climate models to represent precipitation.

The underlying idea is to use a link between the Western Pacific monsoon and local flood characteristics: the variance of the monsoon drives a non-stationary flood frequency model, yielding a direct estimate of flood probabilities. This approach bypasses the uncertain precipitation, since the monsoon variance is derived from large-scale wind fields which are better represented by climate models. The simplicity of the monsoon\textendash flood link allows deriving large ensembles of flood projections under climate change. We conclude that this is a worthwhile, complementary approach to the typical model chains in catchments where a substantial link between climate and floods is found.}

An effort was made to identify the temporal resolution that contains most of the interannual variability of both flood regime of the Mekong and monsoon intensity. {$<$}br{$><$}br{$>$} We found a close connection between the Western Pacific monsoon and the discharge in Kratie and other stations in the Southern Mekong region. In the frequency domain, the interannual to decadal variance of the Mekong discharge closely follows that of the Western Pacific monsoon. More importantly, the well-known regime shift of 1976 in the North Pacific is detectable in the frequency domain for flood discharge and monsoon intensity. This suggests a relationship between Pacific sea surface temperature and monsoon variance, which is a good predictor for flood variance. This dependence influences the probability of occurrence of floods in the Mekong Delta.}

The Gaussian mixture representation of a multivariate t distribution is used as a starting point to construct two new copulas, the skewed t copula and the grouped t copula, which allow more heterogeneity in the modelling of dependent observations. Extreme value considerations are used to derive two further new copulas: the t extreme value copula is the limiting copula of componentwise maxima of t distributed random vectors; the t lower tail copula is the limiting copula of bivariate observations from a t distribution that are conditioned to lie below some joint threshold that is progressively lowered. Both these copulas may be approximated for practical purposes by simpler, better-known copulas, these being the Gumbel and Clayton copulas respectively.}

  abstract = {Empirical evidence of increasing flood damages and the prospect of climatic change has initiated discussions in the flood management community on how to effectively manage flood risks. In the Netherlands, the framework of multi-layer safety (MLS) has been introduced to support this risk-based approach. The MLS framework consists of three layers: (i) prevention, (ii) spatial planning and (iii) evacuation. This paper presents a methodology to evaluate measures in the second layer, such as wet proofing, dry proofing or elevating buildings. The methodology uses detailed land-use data for the area around the city of Rotterdam (up to building level) that has recently become available. The vulnerability of these detailed land-use classes to flooding is assessed using the stage\textendash damage curves from different international models. The methodology is demonstrated using a case study in the unembanked area of Rotterdam in the Netherlands, as measures from the second layer may be particularly effective there. The results show that the flood risk in the region is considerable: EUR 36 million p.a. A large part (almost 60~\%) of this risk results from industrial land use, emphasising the need to give this category more attention in flood risk assessments. It was found that building level measures could substantially reduce flood risks in the region because of the relatively low inundation levels of buildings. Risk to residential buildings would be reduced by 40~\% if all buildings would be wet-proofed, by 89~\% if all buildings would be dry-proofed and elevating buildings over 100~cm would render the risk almost zero. While climate change could double the risk in 2100, such building level measures could easily nullify this effect. Despite the high potential of such measures, actual implementation is still limited. This is partly caused by the lack of knowledge regarding these measures by most Dutch companies and the legal impossibility for municipalities to enforce most of these measures as they would go beyond the building codes established at the national level.}

  abstract = {Worldwide, conflict over shared water resources is exacerbated by population growth, economic development, and climate change. In multipurpose water systems, stakeholders can face higher financial risks as a consequence of the higher costs or lower revenues arising from increased hydrological variability and recurrent extreme events. In this context, financial risk hedging tools able to bundle together the uncorrelated risks of wet and dry periods faced by different stakeholders may be an improved solution to both foster cooperation and manage the financial losses associated with extreme events. In this work, we explore the potential of risk diversification strategies, involving an index insurance contract solution, to simultaneously manage financial risk in a multipurpose water system prone to both drought and flood risk. Risk diversification can allow for reduced insurance premiums in situations in which the bundled risks are uncorrelated. Using an integrated operational and financial model, we characterize the financial risk associated with the water management policies and design a risk management strategy that bundles together the uncorrelated risk of drought and flood events. The approach is demonstrated using a case study on Lake Maggiore, a subalpine transboundary regulated lake whose management is controversial due to numerous and competing human activities. In particular, we focus on the ongoing conflict among the lake shore population, affected by flood risk, and the downstream farmers' districts, facing drought related losses. Results indicate that bundling uncorrelated risks from competing users is beneficial to both promoting insurance premium affordability and facilitating collaboration schemes at the catchment scale.},

  abstract = {This chapter illustrates the use and value of Engineering Options Analysis (EOA) using two case studies. Each describes the analysis in detail. Each entails the need for plans to monitor projects so that managers know when to exercise options and adapt projects to the future as it develops. The Liquid Natural Gas case (Case Study 1) concerns the development of a liquid natural gas plant in Australia. It: Provides a generic prototype for the analysis of projected innovative developments. Demonstrates the kind of insights that EOA can provide. Highlights the potential advantage of flexibility in size, time, and location of facilities. In particular, it develops the important insight that modular designs may be more profitable than monolithic designs because they enable managers to reduce the significant risk of overdesigned plants, and they increase opportunities by taking advantage of the time and location of increases in demand. The IJmuiden case (Case Study 2) concerns water management and flood control facilities in the Netherlands. It: Demonstrates the application of EOA to cope with uncertainty in natural processes, in contrast to the more traditional context of market uncertainties. Uses diverse scenarios to identify conditions for which a strategy is valid across significant ranges of future conditions, and contrary situations in which a choice depends on belief about the level of risks. Documents how EOA shows which forms of flexibility in design justify their cost (in this case, flexibility in pumping facilities adds significant value, but flexibility in the flood defense height of the structure does not). Shows how the calculation of distributions of possible outcomes provides decisionmakers with useful information concerning worst-case outcomes, unavailable from average outcomes alone.},

First, we present it for what it is: an approach to quantitative analysis for planning, design, and management of engineering systems over time, in the context of uncertainty. We offer a brief introduction to the approach, and then go through each of the broad methodological steps. Second, we underline important differences between EOA and Real Options Analysis (ROA), and contrast EOA briefly with other methods presented in this book. While the chapter synthesizing the DMDU approaches covers this topic in a general way (Chap. 15), it is useful for clarity to cover it briefly here. Since EOA and ROA sound so similar, readers might easily assume they are really very close if not identical\textemdash but they are not! In a nutshell, ROA assumes that we can estimate future uncertainties sufficiently accurately, is generally limited to analyzing a single option at a time, and aims to develop single monetary values for options. EOA deals with deeper uncertainties, handles multiple options simultaneously, and allows for all sorts of measures of benefits and values.},

However, building-level adaptation measures such as floodproofing or building elevation are often evaluated at aggregated spatial scales, which may result in sub-optimal investment decisions. In this paper, we develop a flood risk model and combine it with a micro-scale CBA at the building level to obtain an optimal mix of adaptation measures per area. We apply this approach to Venice Beach in Los Angeles and Naples in Long Beach. We subsequently compare our results with the conventional, spatially aggregated area-based CBA approach. Our findings show that a mix of 35\%\textendash 45\% dry-floodproofing measures and 55\%\textendash 65\% building elevation measures is optimal. Elevation works best in areas with high inundation depths, while dry-floodproofing is preferable in areas with shallow inundation depths. The optimal mix of measures derived from our micro-scale approach results in an economic efficiency up to 85\% higher than that yielded by the commonly applied spatially aggregated approach. We therefore recommend that economic evaluations of building-level adaptation measures are conducted at the smallest possible scale, or that CBAs are performed on disaggregated areas based on inundation depth.}

  abstract = {We compared students' self-reported perception of learning with their actual learning under controlled conditions in large-enrollment introductory college physics courses taught using 1) active instruction (following best practices in the discipline) and 2) passive instruction (lectures by experienced and highly rated instructors). Both groups received identical class content and handouts, students were randomly assigned, and the instructor made no effort to persuade students of the benefit of either method. Students in active classrooms learned more (as would be expected based on prior research), but their perception of learning, while positive, was lower than that of their peers in passive environments. This suggests that attempts to evaluate instruction based on students' perceptions of learning could inadvertently promote inferior (passive) pedagogical methods. For instance, a superstar lecturer could create such a positive feeling of learning that students would choose those lectures over active learning. Most importantly, these results suggest that when students experience the increased cognitive effort associated with active learning, they initially take that effort to signify poorer learning. That disconnect may have a detrimental effect on students' motivation, engagement, and ability to self-regulate their own learning. Although students can, on their own, discover the increased value of being actively engaged during a semester-long course, their learning may be impaired during the initial part of the course. We discuss strategies that instructors can use, early in the semester, to improve students' response to being actively engaged in the classroom.},

Using over a century of daily climate data and recent spatially detailed economic, crop yield, and related parameters, we use an optimization model to show that by shifting the geographies where crops are procured from and grown, the government's procurement targets could be met on average even without irrigation, while increasing net farm income and arresting groundwater depletion. Allowing irrigation increases the average net farm income by 30\%. The associated reduction in electricity subsidies in areas with significant groundwater depletion can help offset the needed spatial re-distribution of farm income, a key political obstacle to changes in the procurement system.},

This study shows that the record floods during March 2019 across the Middle East were caused by a powerful AR, originated from the North Atlantic Ocean. Iran, in particular, was substantially affected by the floods. The nearly 9000 km long AR propagated across North Africa and the Middle-East, and was fed by additional moisture from several other sources on its pathway. Simultaneous presence of a mid-latitude system and a subtropical jet facilitated the moisture supply. The AR, as passing over the Zagros Mountains, produced record rainfall induced by the orographic forcing.

  abstract = {Wildfires could pose a significant danger to electrical transmission lines and cause considerable losses to the power grids and residents nearby. Previous studies of preventing wildfire damages to electrical transmission lines mostly analyze wildfire and power system security independently due to their differences in disciplines and cannot satisfy the requirement of the power grid for active and timely responses. In this paper, we have designed an integrated wildfire early warning system framework for power grids, taking prediction of wildfires and early warning of line outage probability together. First, the proposed model simulates the spatiotemporal process of wildfires via a geography cellular automata model and predicts when and where wildfires initially get into the security buffer of an electrical transmission line. It is developed in the context of electrical transmission line operating with various situations of topography, vegetation, wind and, especially, multiple ignition points. Second, we have proposed a line outage model (LOM), based on wildfire prediction and breakdown mechanisms of the air gap, to predict the breakdown probability varying with time and the most vulnerable poles at the holistic line scale. Finally, to illustrate the validation and rationality of our proposed system, a case study for a 500-kV transmission line near Miyi county, China, is presented, and the results under various wildfire situations are studied and compared. By integrating wildfire prediction into the LOM and alarming the holistic line breakdown probability along time, this paper makes a significant contribution in the early warning system to prevent transmission lines to be damaged by wildfires, illustrating the related breakdown mechanisms at the line operation level rather than laboratory experiments only. Meanwhile, the implementation of cellular automata model under comprehensive environmental conditions and simulation of the breakdown probability for the 500-kV transmission line could serve as references for other studies in the community.}

In order to facilitate the critical discussion, state-of-art techniques in the field of flood inundation modelling are applied to a specific test site (River Dee, UK). Specifically, different flood-plain maps are derived for this test site. A first map is built by applying an advanced deterministic approach: use of a fully two-dimensional finite element model (TELEMAC-2D), calibrated against a historical flood extent, to derive a 1-in-100 year flood inundation map. A second map is derived by using a probabilistic approach: use of a simple raster-based inundation model (LISFLOOD-FP) to derive an uncertain flood extent map predicting the 1-in-100 year event conditioned on the extent of the 2006 flood. The flood-plain maps are then compared and the advantages and disadvantages of the two different approaches are critically discussed. Citation Di Baldassarre, G., Schumann, G., Bates, P.

There is a growing global concern about the need to identify the causes for such increased flood damages. To this end, we analyze a large, consistent and reliable dataset of floods in Africa. Identification of causes is not easy given the diverse economic settings, demographic distribution and hydro-climatic conditions of the African continent. On the other hand, many African river basins have a relatively low level of human disturbance and, therefore, provide a unique opportunity to analyze climatic effects on floods. We find that intensive and unplanned human settlements in flood-prone areas appears to be playing a major role in increasing flood risk. Timely and economically sustainable actions, such as the discouragement of human settlements in flood-prone areas and the introduction of early warning systems are, therefore, urgently needed.},

  abstract = {Managed retreat in the form of voluntary flood-buyout programs provides homeowners with an alternative to repairing and rebuilding residences that have sustained severe flood damage. Buyout programs are most economically efficient when groups of neighboring properties are acquired because they can then create unfragmented flood control areas and reduce the cost of providing local services. However, buyout programs in the United States often fail to acquire such efficient, unfragmented spaces, for various reasons, including long administrative timelines, the way in which buyout offers are made, desires for community cohesion, and attachments to place. Buyout programs have relied primarily on posted price mechanisms involving offers that are accepted or rejected by homeowners with little or no negotiation. In this paper, we describe four alternative strategies that have been used successfully in land-preservation agricultural\textendash environmental contexts to increase acceptance rates and decrease fragmentation: agglomeration bonuses, reverse auctions, target constraints, and hybrid approaches. We discuss challenges that may arise during their implementation in the buyout context\textemdash transaction costs, equity and distributional impacts, unintended consequences, and social pressure\textemdash and recommend further research into the efficiency and equity of applying these strategies to residential buyout programs with the explicit goal of promoting spatial coordination.

  abstract = {Long and temporally consistent rainfall time series are essential in climate analyses and applications. Rainfall data from station observations are inadequate over many parts of the world due to sparse or non-existent observation networks, or limited reporting of gauge observations. As a result, satellite rainfall estimates have been used as an alternative or as a supplement to station observations. However, many satellite-based rainfall products with long time series suffer from coarse spatial and temporal resolutions and inhomogeneities caused by variations in satellite inputs. There are some satellite rainfall products with reasonably consistent time series, but they are often limited to specific geographic areas. The Climate Hazards Group Infrared Precipitation (CHIRP) and CHIRP combined with station observations (CHIRPS) are recently produced satellite-based rainfall products with relatively high spatial and temporal resolutions and quasi-global coverage. In this study, CHIRP and CHIRPS were evaluated over East Africa at daily, dekadal (10-day) and monthly time-scales. The evaluation was done by comparing the satellite products with rain-gauge data from about 1,200 stations. The CHIRP and CHIRPS products were also compared with two similar operational satellite rainfall products: the African Rainfall Climatology version 2 (ARC2) and the Tropical Applications of Meteorology using Satellite data (TAMSAT). The results show that both CHIRP and CHIRPS products are significantly better than ARC2 with higher skill and low or no bias. These products were also found to be slightly better than the latest version of the TAMSAT product at dekadal and monthly time-scales, while TAMSAT performed better at the daily time-scale. The performance of the different satellite products exhibits high spatial variability with weak performances over coastal and mountainous regions.},

First, we evaluate the utility of multiple lead time forecasts, both in isolation and in combination, to determine the sensitivity of optimal operations to forecast lead time. We then use time-varying sensitivities to determine how the system utilizes a particular forecast through time for two policies that emphasize hydropower and environmental objectives, respectively, in order to determine how the value of inflow information changes with respect to stakeholder preferences and evolving hydrologic conditions. Results show that the value of inflow information varies greatly depending on the objectives being emphasized and can decline or fade entirely when system constraints (e.g.,~lower bounds on reservoir stage and spillway thresholds) inhibit the use of forecasts to inform decisions, particularly during extreme events.},

  abstract = {Green infrastructure network (GIN) optimization is an effective measure to reduce the landscape fragmentation caused by rapid urbanization. However, there are few targeted and practical studies of GINs in high-density urban areas with a prominent contradiction between ecological construction and land scarcity, leading to insufficient feasibility of most optimization paths as they avoid practical contradictions (scarcity of land, high cost, etc.). As an effective way to economically increase green infrastructure, green roofs have been demonstrated to provide habitats and stepping stones to increase landscape connectivity for high-mobility organisms. However, few studies have applied green roofs to GIN optimization. To address this question, a new approach to optimize GINs was proposed from the perspective of integrating potential green roofs (PGRs). A complete and feasible workflow was also established to rapidly, accurately, and cost-effectively extract PGRs, scientifically evaluate the comprehensive landscape connectivity accounting for PGR isolation factors, and practically optimize GINs according to the spatial differentiation of PGRs with high landscape connectivity. This was done by integrating high-spatial-resolution remote sensing, machine learning, morphological spatial pattern analysis, landscape index method, and a minimum cumulative resistance model. A case study in a typical high-density urban area within the Beijing Fifth Ring Road, China demonstrated the applicability and implications of the workflow. The results clearly showed that the study area had a high potential for green roof retrofitting, PGRs with high landscape connectivity could effectively improve the GINs, and the spatial differentiation characteristics of the PGR network optimization benefits provided the scientific guidance for developing targeted ecological strategies. The new approach effectively improves the scientificity and implementability of GINs. It also provides a strong reference for landscape planning and ecological construction in other high-density urban areas facing the contradiction between ecological construction and land scarcity.}

  abstract = {The Geophysical Fluid Dynamics Laboratory (GFDL) has developed a coupled general circulation model (CM3) for the atmosphere, oceans, land, and sea ice. The goal of CM3 is to address emerging issues in climate change, including aerosol\textendash cloud interactions, chemistry\textendash climate interactions, and coupling between the troposphere and stratosphere. The model is also designed to serve as the physical system component of earth system models and models for decadal prediction in the near-term future\textemdash for example, through improved simulations in tropical land precipitation relative to earlier-generation GFDL models. This paper describes the dynamical core, physical parameterizations, and basic simulation characteristics of the atmospheric component (AM3) of this model. Relative to GFDL AM2, AM3 includes new treatments of deep and shallow cumulus convection, cloud droplet activation by aerosols, subgrid variability of stratiform vertical velocities for droplet activation, and atmospheric chemistry driven by emissions with advective, convective, and turbulent transport. AM3 employs a cubed-sphere implementation of a finite-volume dynamical core and is coupled to LM3, a new land model with ecosystem dynamics and hydrology. Its horizontal resolution is approximately 200 km, and its vertical resolution ranges approximately from 70 m near the earth's surface to 1 to 1.5 km near the tropopause and 3 to 4 km in much of the stratosphere. Most basic circulation features in AM3 are simulated as realistically, or more so, as in AM2. In particular, dry biases have been reduced over South America. In coupled mode, the simulation of Arctic sea ice concentration has improved. AM3 aerosol optical depths, scattering properties, and surface clear-sky downward shortwave radiation are more realistic than in AM2. The simulation of marine stratocumulus decks remains problematic, as in AM2. The most intense 0.2\% of precipitation rates occur less frequently in AM3 than observed. The last two decades of the twentieth century warm in CM3 by 0.32\textdegree C relative to 1881\textendash 1920. The Climate Research Unit (CRU) and Goddard Institute for Space Studies analyses of observations show warming of 0.56\textdegree{} and 0.52\textdegree C, respectively, over this period. CM3 includes anthropogenic cooling by aerosol\textendash cloud interactions, and its warming by the late twentieth century is somewhat less realistic than in CM2.1, which warmed 0.66\textdegree C but did not include aerosol\textendash cloud interactions. The improved simulation of the direct aerosol effect (apparent in surface clear-sky downward radiation) in CM3 evidently acts in concert with its simulation of cloud\textendash aerosol interactions to limit greenhouse gas warming.}

  abstract = {Abstract The seasonal cycle of the heating of the atmosphere is divided into a component due to direct solar absorption in the atmosphere and a component due to the flux of energy from the surface to the atmosphere via latent, sensible, and radiative heat fluxes. Both observations and coupled climate models are analyzed. The vast majority of the seasonal heating of the northern extratropics (78\% in the observations and 67\% in the model average) is due to atmospheric shortwave absorption. In the southern extratropics, the seasonal heating of the atmosphere is entirely due to atmospheric shortwave absorption in both the observations and the models, and the surface heat flux opposes the seasonal heating of the atmosphere. The seasonal cycle of atmospheric temperature is surface amplified in the northern extratropics and nearly barotropic in the Southern Hemisphere; in both cases, the vertical profile of temperature reflects the source of the seasonal heating. In the northern extratropics, the seasonal cycle of atmospheric heating over land differs markedly from that over the ocean. Over the land, the surface energy fluxes complement the driving absorbed shortwave flux; over the ocean, they oppose the absorbed shortwave flux. This gives rise to large seasonal differences in the temperature of the atmosphere over land and ocean. Downgradient temperature advection by the mean westerly winds damps the seasonal cycle of heating of the atmosphere over the land and amplifies it over the ocean. The seasonal cycle in the zonal energy transport is 4.1 PW. Finally, the authors examine the change in the seasonal cycle of atmospheric heating in 11 models from phase 3 of the Coupled Model Intercomparison Project (CMIP3) due to a doubling of atmospheric carbon dioxide from preindustrial concentrations. The seasonal heating of the troposphere is everywhere enhanced by increased shortwave absorption by water vapor; it is reduced where sea ice has been replaced by ocean, which increases the effective heat storage reservoir of the climate system and thereby reduces the seasonal magnitude of energy fluxes between the surface and the atmosphere. As a result, the seasonal amplitude of temperature increases in the upper troposphere (where atmospheric shortwave absorption increases) and decreases at the surface (where the ice melts).},

  abstract = {Abstract. This is the second of two papers that document the creation of the New European Wind Atlas (NEWA). In Part~1, we described the sensitivity experiments and accompanying evaluation done to arrive at the final mesoscale model setup used to produce the mesoscale wind atlas. In this paper, Part~2, we document how we made the final wind atlas product, covering both the production of the mesoscale climatology generated with the Weather Research and Forecasting (WRF) model and the microscale climatology generated with the Wind Atlas Analysis and Applications Program (WAsP). The paper includes a detailed description of the technical and practical aspects that went into running the mesoscale simulations and the downscaling using WAsP. We show the main results from the final wind atlas and present a comprehensive evaluation of each component of the NEWA model chain using observations from a large set of tall masts located all over Europe. The added value of the WRF and WAsP downscaling of wind climatologies is evaluated relative to the performance of the driving ERA5 reanalysis and shows that the WRF downscaling reduces the mean wind speed bias and spread relative to that of ERA5 from -1.50{$\pm$}1.30 to 0.02{$\pm$}0.78\,m\,s-1. The WAsP downscaling has an added positive impact relative to that of the WRF model in simple terrain. In complex terrain, where the assumptions of the linearized flow model break down, both the mean bias and spread in wind speed are worse than those from the raw mesoscale results.}

  abstract = {We employ a large ensemble of Regional Climate Models (RCMs) from the COordinated Regional-climate Downscaling EXperiment to explore two questions: (1) what can we know about the future precipitation characteristics over Africa? and (2) does this information differ from that derived from the driving Global Climate Models (GCMs)? By taking into account both the statistical significance of the change and the models' agreement on its sign, we identify regions where the projected climate change signal is robust, suggesting confidence that the precipitation characteristics will change, and those where changes in the precipitation statistics are non-significant. Results show that, when spatially averaged, the RCMs median change is usually in agreement with that of the GCMs ensemble: even though the change in seasonal mean precipitation may differ, in some cases, other precipitation characteristics (e.g., intensity, frequency, and duration of dry and wet spells) show the same tendency. When the robust change (i.e., the value of the change averaged only over the land points where it is robust) is compared between the GCMs and RCMs, similarities are striking, indicating that, although with some uncertainty on the geographical extent, GCMs and RCMs project a consistent future. Potential added value of downscaling future climate projections (i.e., non-negligible fine-scale information that is absent in the lower resolution simulations) is found for instance over the Ethiopian highlands, where the RCM ensemble shows a robust decrease in mean precipitation in contrast with the GCMs results. This discrepancy may be associated with the better representation of topographical details that are missing in the large scale GCMs. The impact of the heterogeneity of the GCM\textendash RCM matrix on the results has been also investigated; we found that, for most regions and indices, where results are robust or non-significant, they are so independently on the choice of the RCM or GCM. However, there are cases, especially over Central Africa and parts of West Africa, where results are uncertain, i.e. most of the RCMs project a statistically significant change but they do not agree on its sign. In these cases, especially where results are clearly clustered according to the RCM, there is not a simple way of subsampling the model ensemble in order to reduce the uncertainty or to infer a more robust result.}

  abstract = {Infrastructure systems around the world face immediate crises and smoldering long-term challenges. Consequently, system owners and managers must balance the need to repair and replace the aging and deteriorating systems already in place against the need for transformative investments in deep decarbonization, climate adaptation, and transportation that will enable long-term competitiveness. Complicating these decisions are deep uncertainties, finite resources, and competing objectives.       These challenges motivate the integration of ``hard'' investments in physical infrastructure with ``soft'' instruments like insurance, land use policy, and ecosystem restoration that can improve service, shrink costs, scale up or down as future needs require, and reduce vulnerability to population loss and economic contraction. A critical advantage of soft instruments is that they enable planners to adjust, expand, or reduce them at regular intervals, unlike hard instruments which are difficult to modify once in place. As a result, soft instruments can be precisely tailored to meet near-term needs and conditions, including projections of the quasi-oscillatory, regime-like climate processes that dominate seasonal to decadal hydro-climate variability, thereby reducing the need to guess the needs and hazards of the distant future. The objective of this dissertation is to demonstrate how potentially predictable modes of structured climate variability can inform the design of soft instruments and the formulation of adaptive infrastructure system plans.       Using climate information for sequential adaptation requires developing credible projections of climate variables at relevant time scales. PartI considers the drivers of river floods in large river basins, which is used throughout this dissertation as an example of a high-impact hydroclimate extreme. First, chapter 2 opens by exploring the strengths and limitations of existing methodologies, and by developing a statistical-dynamical causal chain framework within which to consider flood risk on interannual to secular time scales. Next, chapter 3 describes the physical mechanisms responsible for heavy rainfall (90th percentile exceedance)and flooding in the Lower Paraguay River Basin (LPRB), focusing on a November-February(NDJF) 2015-16 flood event that displaced over 170 000 people. This chapter shows that:       1. persistent large-scale conditions over the South American continent during NDJF 2015-16 strengthened the South American Low-Level Jet (SALLJ), bringing warm air and moisture to South East South America (SESA), and steered the jet towards the LPRB, leading to repeated heavy rainfall events and large-scale flooding;       2. while the observed El Ni\~no event contributed to a stronger SALLJ, the Madden-JulienOscillation (MJO) and Atlantic ocean steered the jet over the LPRB; and       3. while numerical sub-seasonal to seasonal (S2S) and seasonal models projected an elevated risk of flooding consistent with the observed El Ni\~no event, they had limited skill at lead times greater than two weeks, suggesting that improved representation of MJO and Atlantic teleconnections could improve regional forecast skill.       Finally, chapter 4 shows how mechanistic understanding of the physical causal chain that leads to a particular hazard of interest \textendash{} in this case heavy rainfall over a large area in the Ohio River Basin (ORB) \textendash{} can inform future risks. Taking the GFDL coupled model, version 3 (CM3) as a representative general circulation model (GCM), this chapter shows that       1. the GCM simulates too many regional extreme precipitation (REP) events but under-simulates the occurrence of back to back REP days;       2. REP days show consistent large-scale climate anomalies leading up to the event;       3. indices describing these large-scale anomalies are well simulated by the GCM; and       4. a statistical model describing this causal chain and exploiting simulated large-scale in-dices from the GCM can be used to inform the future occurrence of REP days.       Even the best climate projections must confront epistemic uncertainties. Part II of this dissertation explores how intrinsically flawed projections should inform sequential adaptation.First, chapter5reviews approaches for planning under uncertainty, considering the role of classical decision theory, optimization, probability, and non probabilistic approaches. Next, chapter 6 considers how different physical mechanisms impart predictability at different timescales and the implications of secular, low-frequency cyclical, and high-frequency cyclical variability for selection between instruments with long and short planning periods. In particular, this chapter builds from three assertions regarding the nature of climate risk:       1. different climate risk mitigation instruments have different project lifespans;       2. climate risk varies on many scales; and       3. the processes which dominate this risk over the planning period depend on the planning period itself.       Defining M as the nominal design life of a structural or financial instrument and N as the length of the observational record (a proxy for total informational uncertainty), chapter 7 presents a series of stylized computational experiments to probe the implications of these premises. Key findings are that:       1. quasi-periodic and secular climate signals, with different identifiability and predictability, control future uncertainty and risk;       2. adaptation strategies need to consider how uncertainties in risk projections influence the success of decision pathways; and       3. stylized experiments reveal how bias and variance of climate risk projections influencerisk mitigation over a finite planning period.       Chapter 7 elaborates these findings through a didactic case study of levee heightening in the Netherlands. Integrating a conceptual model of low-frequency variability with credible projections of sea level rise, chapter 7 uses dynamic programming to co-optimize hard (levee increase) and soft (insurance) instruments. Key findings are that       1. large but distant and uncertain changes (e.g., sea level rise) do not necessarily motivate immediate investment in structural risk protection;       2. soft adaptation strategies are robust to different model structures and assumptions while hard instruments perform poorly under conditions for which they were not de-signed; and       3. increasing the hypothetical predictability of near-term climate extremes significantly lowers long-term adaptation costs.       Finally, part III seeks to unpack the conceptual experiments of parts I and II to inform policy and future research. Chapter 8 describes how constructive narratives about climate change can discourage climate fatalism. Instead, chapter 8 emphasizes that while climate change is and will be a critical stressor of infrastructure systems, individuals, communities, and regions have agency and can mitigate its consequences. Finally, chapter9concludes by discussing the key findings of this dissertation and exploring how future work on decision under uncertainty, technology, and earth systems science can aid the design and management of effective infrastructure services.},

Decisions about managing these infrastructure systems are strongly informed by societal perceptions of risk, which in turn are shaped through narratives of high-impact events in academic, governmental, commercial, and popular media. In recent years, post hoc analyses of high-impact water and climate disasters have increasingly focused on the role of anthropogenic climate change (ACC). This is a welcome development that helps to build support for much-needed mitigation of global greenhouse gas emissions and pushes companies, governments, and aid agencies to prepare for a changing environment. Yet climate impacts require a confluence of physical hazards and societal vulnerabilities, and so narratives centered only on the role of ACC can neglect the aging infrastructure, increasing development with exposure to climate risks, and inadequate maintenance that set the stage for meteorological and hydrological events to become humanitarian disasters. The fatalistic narratives that emerge, which often imply that because an event was exacerbated by climate change its consequences could not have been averted, discourage adaptive planning.},

  abstract = {During the austral summer 2015/16, severe flooding displaced over 170 000 people on the Paraguay River system in Paraguay, Argentina, and southern Brazil. These floods were driven by repeated heavy rainfall events in the lower Paraguay River basin. Alternating sequences of enhanced moisture inflow from the South American low-level jet and local convergence associated with baroclinic systems were conducive to mesoscale convective activity and enhanced precipitation. These circulation patterns were favored by cross-time-scale interactions of a very strong El Ni\~no event, an unusually persistent Madden\textendash Julian oscillation in phases 4 and 5, and the presence of a dipole SST anomaly in the central southern Atlantic Ocean. The simultaneous use of seasonal and subseasonal heavy rainfall predictions could have provided decision-makers with useful information about the start of these flooding events from two to four weeks in advance. Probabilistic seasonal forecasts available at the beginning of November successfully indicated heightened probability of heavy rainfall (90th percentile) over southern Paraguay and Brazil for December\textendash February. Raw subseasonal forecasts of heavy rainfall exhibited limited skill at lead times beyond the first two predicted weeks, but a model output statistics approach involving principal component regression substantially improved the spatial distribution of skill for week 3 relative to other methods tested, including extended logistic regressions. A continuous monitoring of climate drivers impacting rainfall in the region, and the use of statistically corrected heavy precipitation seasonal and subseasonal forecasts, may help improve flood preparedness in this and other regions.},

  abstract = {The assessment and implementation of structural or financial instruments for climate risk mitigation requires projections of future climate risk over the operational life of each proposed instrument. A point often neglected in the climate adaptation literature is that the physical sources of predictability differ between projects with long and short planning periods: while historical and paleo climate records emphasize modes of variability, anthropogenic climate change is expected to alter their occurrence at longer time scales. In this paper we present a set of stylized experiments to assess the uncertainties and biases involved in estimating future climate risk over a finite future period, given a limited observational record. These experiments consider both quasi-periodic and secular change for the underlying risk, as well as statistical models for estimating this risk from an N-year historical record. The uncertainty of IPCC-like future scenarios is considered through an equivalent sample size N. The relative importance of estimating the short- or long-term risk extremes depends on the investment life M. Shorter design lives are preferred for situations where inter-annual to decadal variability can be successfully identified and predicted, suggesting the importance of sequential investment strategies for adaptation.},

Application of this model to analysis of the P1MC reveals the heterogeneous climate in this region causes large spatial variability in the effectiveness of this program. In addition, the size of the area of capture, the run-off coefficient of the roofs, and the amount of first-flush diversion also have important effects. This analysis demonstrates while rainwater capture can offer sufficient water for drinking, as a stand-alone solution it cannot meet P1MC objectives of guaranteeing sustainable and universal access to water for drinking, cooking, and basic hygiene in all regions and years.},

One such challenge is how to present trade-offs under deep uncertainty in a salient and interpretable manner. Some common approaches include analyzing a small subset of projections or invoking Laplace's principle of insufficient reason to justify a simple average. These approaches can underestimate risks, hide deep uncertainties, and provide little insight into which assumptions drive decision-relevant outcomes.

Next, a small set of probability distributions representing subjective beliefs about the likelihood of possible futures is used to weight the scenarios.

  abstract = {Projections of nonstationary climate risks can vary considerably from one source to another, posing considerable communication and decision-analytical challenges. One such challenge is how to present trade-offs under deep uncertainty in a salient and interpretable manner. Some common approaches include analyzing a small subset of projections or treating all considered projections as equally likely. These approaches can underestimate risks, hide deep uncertainties, and are mostly silent on which assumptions drive decision-relevant outcomes. Here we introduce and demonstrate a transparent Bayesian framework for synthesizing deep uncertainties to inform climate risk management. The first step of this workflow is to generate an ensemble of simulations representing possible futures and analyze them through standard exploratory modeling techniques.

  abstract = {Winter storm Uri brought severe cold to the southern United States in February 2021, causing a cascading failure of interdependent systems in Texas where infrastructure was not adequately prepared for such cold. In particular, the failure of interconnected energy systems restricted electricity supply just as demand for heating spiked, leaving millions of Texans without heat or electricity, many for several days. This motivates the question: did historical storms suggest that such temperatures were known to occur, and if so with what frequency? We compute a temperature-based proxy for heating demand and use this metric to answer the question ``what would the aggregate demand for heating have been had historic cold snaps occurred with today's population?''. We find that local temperatures and the inferred demand for heating per capita across the region served by the Texas Interconnection were more severe during a storm in December 1989 than during February 2021, and that cold snaps in 1951 and 1983 were nearly as severe. Given anticipated population growth, future storms may lead to even greater infrastructure failures if adaptive investments are not made. Further, electricity system managers should prepare for trends in electrification of heating to drive peak annual loads on the Texas Interconnection during severe winter storms.},

Here, we appraise the potential of four key adaptation strategies to reduce flood risk across Europe based on flood risk modelling and cost\textendash benefit analysis. We find that reducing flood peaks using detention areas is economically the most attractive option. In a scenario without climate mitigation (3\,\textdegree C global warming), they can lower projected flood losses in Europe by 2100 from \texteuro 44(30\textendash 61)\,billion to \texteuro 8.1(5.5\textendash 10.7)\,billion per year and lower population exposed by 84\% (75\textendash 90\%) or achieve a risk level comparable to today. The economic investment required over 2020\textendash 2100 would provide a return of \texteuro 4(3.5\textendash 6.3) for each \texteuro 1 invested. The risk reduction potential of strengthening of dykes is somewhat lower, at 70\% (59\textendash 83\%) for a comparable annual investment. Implementing building-based flood proofing and relocation measures is less cost-effective but can reduce impacts in localized areas.},

We find that the introduction of LDS lowers total system costs relative to wind-solar-battery systems, and that system costs are twice as sensitive to reductions in LDS costs as to reductions in battery costs. In least-cost systems, batteries are used primarily for intra-day storage and LDS is used primarily for inter-season and multi-year storage. Moreover, dependence on LDS increases when the system is optimized over more years. LDS technologies could improve the affordability of renewable electricity.}

  abstract = {Increasing frequency of extreme precipitation events under the future warming climate makes the storm-related pollutant release more and more threatening to coastal ecosystems. Hurricane Harvey, a 1000-year extreme precipitation event, caused massive pollutant release from the Houston metropolitan area to the adjacent Galveston Bay. 0.57~\texttimes ~106 tons of raw sewage and 22,000 barrels of oil, refined fuels and chemicals were reportly released during Harvey, which would likely deteriorate the water quality and damage the coastal ecosystem. Using a Lagrangian particle-tracking method coupled with a validated 3D hydrodynamic model, we examined the retention, pathway, and fate of the released pollutants. A new timescale, local exposure time (LET), is introduced to quantitatively evaluate the spatially varying susceptibility inside the bay and over the shelf, with a larger LET indicating the region is more susceptible to the released pollutants. We found LET inside the bay is at least one order of magnitude larger for post-storm release than storm release due to a quick recovery in the system's flushing. More than 90\% of pollutants released during the storm exited the bay within two days, while those released after the storm could stay inside the bay for up to three months. This implies that post-storm release is potentially more damaging to water quality and ecosystem health. Our results suggest that not only the amount of total pollutant load but also the release timing should be considered when assessing a storm's environmental and ecological influence, because there could be large amounts of pollutants steadily and slowly discharged after storm through groundwater, sewage systems, and reservoirs.}

This dataset only contains the NCEP 4 KM GRIB Data hourly, 6-hourly, and daily radar estimate after bias removal. 6-hourly data are generally available at 00Z, 06Z, 12Z, and 18Z. Daily data are generally available at 12Z. Depending on the time period selected, all three datasets may or may not be available. Other NCEP 4 KM GRIB Data including gage-only analysis, multi-sensor analysis (gage and unbiased radar), radar estimate (no bias removal), and gage-only analysis using 24h accumulated ("RFC") data are available as independent datasets. Depending on the time period selected, all five types may or may not be available. Please see GCIP/EOP: Surface NCEP Ancillary Catalogue of Available GCIP Precipitation Data (NCEP/EMC). The format of the files is GRIB. The files are compressed using the UNIX "compress" command and "uncompress" must be used before decoding. This dataset is provided as is and was not quality controlled by UCAR/JOSS. Beginning 1 Jan 2002, the analysis grid has been changed to conform with the official NWS HRAP grid. File names have also been changed. See the readme provided with this dataset for details. As of April 2017 this data includes Alaska and Puerto Rico stations.}

  abstract = {Flood risk is expected to increase in coastal cities, particularly in Asian megacities such as Shanghai. This paper presents an integrated modeling framework to simulate changes in the flood risk in Shanghai and provide a cost-benefit analysis of multiple adaptation strategies used to reduce risk. The results show that the potential flood risk will increase dramatically as a result of sea level rise, land subsidence, and socioeconomic development. By 2100, the expected annual damage could reach 0.8\% (uncertainty range: 0.4\%\textendash 1.4\%) of local GDP under an optimistic emission scenario (RCP4.5), compared to the current value of 0.03\%. All of the adaptation strategies can effectively reduce the flood risk under the current conditions and those in 2050. In contrast to the `hard' flood protection strategies (i.e., storm-surge barriers and floodwalls), the `soft' strategies (i.e., building codes and nature-based measures) cannot substantially reduce the flood risk in 2100. However, the soft strategies can play a critical role in reducing the residual risk resulting from the hard strategies. A `hybrid' strategy combining a storm-surge barrier, wet-proofing, and coastal wetland development outperforms both hard and soft strategies in terms of low residual risk and high benefit/cost ratio. Additionally, the hybrid strategy can also enable a larger reduction in casualties. These findings imply that managing flood risk is more than the use of single adaptation measures. The methodology developed in this paper can enlighten Shanghai and other coastal cities on an economically and socially feasible adaptation strategy in an uncertain future.}

  abstract = {The North Atlantic and Europe experienced two extreme climate events in 2015: exceptionally cold ocean surface temperatures and a summer heat wave ranked in the top ten over the past 65 years. Here, we show that the cold ocean temperatures were the most extreme in the modern record over much of the mid-high latitude North-East Atlantic. Further, by considering surface heat loss, ocean heat content and wind driven upwelling we explain for the first time the genesis of this cold ocean anomaly. We find that it is primarily due to extreme ocean heat loss driven by atmospheric circulation changes in the preceding two winters combined with the re-emergence of cold ocean water masses. Furthermore, we reveal that a similar cold Atlantic anomaly was also present prior to the most extreme European heat waves since the 1980s indicating that it is a common factor in the development of these events. For the specific case of 2015, we show that the ocean anomaly is linked to a stationary position of the Jet Stream that favours the development of high surface temperatures over Central Europe during the heat wave. Our study calls for an urgent assessment of the impact of ocean drivers on major European summer temperature extremes in order to provide better advance warning measures of these high societal impact events.}

We find no evidence that current moves towards dam construction will stop, and consider two scenarios for the future of the fisheries and other ecosystems of the basin.

  abstract = {The intensity and distribution of daily precipitation is predicted to change under scenarios of increased greenhouse gases (GHGs). In this paper, we analyse the ability of HadCM2, a general circulation model (GCM), and a high-resolution regional climate model (RCM), both developed at the Met Office's Hadley Centre, to simulate extreme daily precipitation by reference to observations. A detailed analysis of daily precipitation is made at two UK grid boxes, where probabilities of reaching daily thresholds in the GCM and RCM are compared with observations. We find that the RCM generally overpredicts probabilities of extreme daily precipitation but that, when the GCM and RCM simulated values are scaled to have the same mean as the observations, the RCM captures the upper-tail distribution more realistically. To compare regional changes in daily precipitation in the GHG-forced period 2080\textendash 2100 in the GCM and the RCM, we develop two methods. The first considers the fractional changes in probability of local daily precipitation reaching or exceeding a fixed 15 mm threshold in the anomaly climate compared with the control. The second method uses the upper one-percentile of the control at each point as the threshold. Agreement between the models is better in both seasons with the latter method, which we suggest may be more useful when considering larger scale spatial changes. On average, the probability of precipitation exceeding the 1\% threshold increases by a factor of 2.5 (GCM and RCM) in winter and by 1.7 (GCM) or 1.3 (RCM) in summer.},

  abstract = {A national 2017 vector control capacity survey was conducted to assess the United States' (U.S.'s) ability to prevent emerging vector-borne disease. Since that survey, the southeastern U.S. has experienced continued autochthonous exotic vector-borne disease transmission and establishment of invasive vector species. To understand the current gaps in control programs and establish a baseline to evaluate future vector control efforts for this vulnerable region, a focused needs assessment survey was conducted in early 2020. The southeastern U.S. region was targeted, as this region has a high probability of novel vector-borne disease introduction. Paper copies delivered in handwritten envelopes and electronic copies of the survey were delivered to 386 unique contacts, and 150 returned surveys were received, corresponding to a 39\% response rate. Overall, the survey found vector control programs serving areas with over 100,000 residents and those affiliated with public health departments had more core capabilities compared to smaller programs and those not affiliated with public health departments. Furthermore, the majority of vector control programs in this region do not routinely monitor for pesticide resistance. Taken as a whole, these results suggest that the majority of the southeastern U.S. is vulnerable to vector-borne disease outbreaks. Results from this survey raise attention to the critical need of providing increased resources to bring all vector control programs to a competent level, ensuring that public health is protected from the threat of vector-borne disease.},

These concerns are increasingly recognized to be pertinent in adaptation to urban flooding. Yet, the technical orientation of many flood adaptation interventions and decision-support may make these issues less visible in flood decision-processes. We draw from recent empirical case studies to identify thematic `points of entry' that can facilitate attention to issues of justice and politics in urban flood decision-support. We map these entry points to four phases of the adaptation decision-process, highlighting lines of inquiry to enable researchers to make these concerns visible in collaboration with partnering organizations and stakeholders. We argue that researchers will need to work with stakeholders to make effective use of existing approaches and methods to explicitly make the political dimensions and issues of justice visible in decision-processes.}

  abstract = {Hurricanes threaten the petroleum industry in the United States and are expected to be influenced by climate change. This study presents an integrated framework for hurricane risk assessment of petroleum infrastructure under changing climatic conditions, calculating risk in terms of monetary loss. Variants of two synthetic probabilistic storms and one historical storm (Hurricane Ike) are simulated using the SWAN+ADCIRC model, representing a range of potential scenarios of impacts of a changing climate on hurricane forward speed and sea-level rise given uncertainties in climate projections. Model outputs inform an infrastructure impact and cascading economic loss analysis that incorporates various sources of uncertainty to estimate five types of losses sustained by petroleum facilities in surge events: land value loss, process-unit damage loss, cost of spill clean-up and repair of aboveground storage tanks, productivity loss, and civil fines. The proposed risk assessment framework is applied as a case study to seven refineries along the Houston Ship Channel (HSC), a densely-industrialized corridor in Texas. The results reveal that either an increase in mean sea level or a decrease in storm forward speed increases the maximum water elevations in the HSC for storms that produce maximum wind setup in Galveston Bay (FEMA 33 and FEMA 36), resulting in larger economic loss estimates. The role of refinery features such as storage capacity and average elevation of the refinery and its critical equipment in the refinery response to hurricane hazards is studied, and the probability distribution of refinery total loss and the loss risk profile in different hurricane scenarios are discussed. Loss estimates are presented, demonstrating the effects of hurricane forward speed and sea level on the losses for the refineries as well as the HSC. Such a framework can enable hurricane risk assessment and loss estimation for petroleum infrastructure to inform future policies and risk mitigation strategies. Potential policy implications for a region like the HSC are highlighted herein as an illustration.}

  abstract = {The ability of general circulation models (GCMs) to correctly simulate precipitation is usually assessed by comparing simulated mean precipitation with observed climatologies. However, to what extent the skill in simulating average precipitation indicates how well the models represent temporal changes is unclear. A direct assessment of the latter is hampered by the fact that freely evolving climate simulations for past periods are not set up to reproduce the specific evolution of internal atmospheric variability. Therefore, model-to-real-world comparisons of time series of daily, monthly, or annual precipitation are not meaningful. Here, for the first time, the authors quantify GCM skill in simulating precipitation variability using simulations in which the temporal evolution of the large-scale atmospheric state closely matches that of the real world. This is achieved by nudging the atmospheric states in the ECHAM5 GCM, but crucially not the precipitation field itself, toward the 40-yr European Centre for Medium-Range Weather Forecasts (ECMWF) Re-Analysis (ERA-40). Global correlation maps between observed and simulated seasonal precipitation allow areas in which simulated future precipitation changes are likely to be meaningful to be identified. In many areas, correlations higher than 0.8 are found.This means also that in these regions the simulated precipitation is a very good predictor for the true precipitation, and thus a statistical correction of the simulated precipitation, which can include a downscaling component, can provide useful estimates for local-scale precipitation. The authors show that a simple scaling of the simulated precipitation performs well in a cross validation and thus appears to be a promising alternative to standard statistical downscaling approaches.}

However, not enough effort has been made to develop planning tools designed to address the implications of these new opportunities and to determine the optimal degree of centralisation of these infrastructures. We introduce a planning tool for sustainable network infrastructure planning (SNIP), a two-step techno-economic heuristic modelling approach based on shortest path-finding and hierarchical-agglomerative clustering algorithms to determine the optimal degree of centralisation in the field of wastewater management. This SNIP model optimises the distribution of wastewater treatment plants and the sewer network outlay relative to several cost and sewer-design parameters. Moreover, it allows us to construct alternative optimal wastewater system designs taking into account topography, economies of scale as well as the full size range of wastewater treatment plants. We quantify and confirm that the optimal degree of centralisation decreases with increasing terrain complexity and settlement dispersion while showing that the effect of the latter exceeds that of topography. Case study results for a Swiss community indicate that the calculated optimal degree of centralisation is substantially lower than the current level.}

  abstract = {Decentralised wastewater treatment is increasingly gaining interest as a means of responding to sustainability challenges. Cost comparisons are a crucial element of any sustainability assessment. While the cost characteristics of centralised waste water management systems (WMS) have been studied extensively, the economics of decentralised WMS are less understood. A key motivation for studying the costs of decentralised WMS is to compare the cost of centralised and decentralised WMS in order to decide on cost-efficient sanitation solutions. This paper outlines a model designed to assess those costs which depend on the spatial density of decentralised wastewater treatment plants in a region. Density-related costs are mostly linked to operation and maintenance activities which depend on transportation, like sludge removal or the visits of professionals to the plants for control, servicing or repairs. We first specify a modelled cost-density relationship for a region in a geometric two-dimensional space by means of heuristic routing algorithms that consider time and load-capacity restrictions. The generic model is then applied to a Swiss case study for which we specify a broad range of modelling parameters. As a result, we identify a `hockey-stick'-shaped cost curve that is characterised by strong cost reductions at high density values which level out at around 1 to 1.5 plants per km2. Variations in the cost curves are mostly due to differences in management approaches (scheduled or unscheduled emptying). In addition to the well-known diseconomies of scale in the case of centralised sanitation, we find a similar generic cost behaviour for decentralised sanitation due to economies of density. Low densities in sparsely populated regions thus result in higher costs for both centralised and decentralised system. Policy implications are that efforts to introduce decentralised options in a region should consider the low-density/high-cost problem when comparing centralised and decentralised options.}

  abstract = {Despite considerable progress in recent years, output of both global and regional circulation models is still afflicted with biases to a degree that precludes its direct use, especially in climate change impact studies. This is well known, and to overcome this problem, bias correction (BC; i.e. the correction of model output towards observations in a post-processing step) has now become a standard procedure in climate change impact studies. In this paper we argue that BC is currently often used in an invalid way: it is added to the GCM/RCM model chain without sufficient proof that the consistency of the latter (i.e. the agreement between model dynamics/model output and our judgement) as well as the generality of its applicability increases. BC methods often impair the advantages of circulation models by altering spatiotemporal field consistency, relations among variables and by violating conservation principles. Currently used BC methods largely neglect feedback mechanisms, and it is unclear whether they are time-invariant under climate change conditions. Applying BC increases agreement of climate model output with observations in hindcasts and hence narrows the uncertainty range of simulations and predictions without, however, providing a satisfactory physical justification. This is in most cases not transparent to the end user. We argue that this hides rather than reduces uncertainty, which may lead to avoidable forejudging of end users and decision makers. We present here a brief overview of state-of-the-art bias correction methods, discuss the related assumptions and implications, draw conclusions on the validity of bias correction and propose ways to cope with biased output of circulation models in the short term and how to reduce the bias in the long term. The most promising strategy for improved future global and regional circulation model simulations is the increase in model resolution to the convection-permitting scale in combination with ensemble predictions based on sophisticated approaches for ensemble perturbation. With this article, we advocate communicating the entire uncertainty range associated with climate change predictions openly and hope to stimulate a lively discussion on bias correction among the atmospheric and hydrological community and end users of climate change impact studies.}

In 2008, the Second Delta Committee recommended increasing legal flood protection standards at least tenfold to compensate for population and economic growth since 1953; this recommendation would have required dike improvement investments estimated at 11.5 billion euro. Our research group was charged with developing efficient flood protection standards in a more objective way. We used cost-benefit analysis and mixed-integer nonlinear programming to demonstrate the efficiency of increasing the legal standards in three critical regions only. Monte Carlo analysis confirms the robustness of this recommendation. In 2012, the state secretary of the Ministry of Infrastructure and the Environment accepted our results as a basis for legislation. Compared to the earlier recommendation, this successful application of operations research yields both a highly significant increase in protection for these regions (in which two-thirds of the benefits of the proposed improvements accrue) and approximately 7.8 billion euro in cost savings. Our methods can also be used in decision making for other flood-prone areas worldwide.}

For example, cities are responsible for 70\% of global greenhouse gas emissions and, at the same time, 90\% of urban areas are situated on coastlines, making the majority of the world's population increasingly vulnerable to climate change. While urbanization accelerates, meeting the challenges will require unprecedented transformative solutions for sustainability with a careful consideration of resilience in their implementation. However, global and local policy processes often use vague or narrow definitions of the concepts of `urban sustainability' and `urban resilience', leading to deep confusion, particularly in instances when the two are used interchangeably. Confusion and vagueness slow down needed transformation processes, since resilience can be undesirable and many sustainability goals contrast, or even challenge efforts to improve resilience. Here, we propose a new framework that resolves current contradictions and tensions; a framework that we believe will significantly help urban policy and implementation processes in addressing new challenges and contributing to global sustainability in the urban century.},

A nonlinear downward trend in the relationship's strength is evident. Variations in sea-level pressures over the extra-tropical North Atlantic Ocean during months immediately prior to the hurricane season provide an explanation for a portion of this secular variability. Atmospheric synoptic conditions associated with the North Atlantic oscillation (NAO) result in hurricanes tracking parallel to southern latitudes en route to the United States.}

  abstract = {Abstract The authors provide a statistical and physical basis for understanding regional variations in major hurricane activity along the U.S. coastline on long timescales. Current statistical models of hurricane activity are focused on the frequency of events over the entire North Atlantic basin. The exception is the lead author's previous work, which models the occurrence of hurricanes over the Caribbean Sea, Gulf of Mexico, and the southeast U.S. coast separately. Here the authors use statistics to analyze data from historical and paleoclimatic records to expand this work. In particular, an inverse correlation in major hurricane activity across latitudes at various timescales is articulated. When activity is above normal at high latitudes it tends to be below normal at low latitudes and vice versa. Past research, paleoclimatic records, and historical data hint at the potential of using the North Atlantic oscillation (NAO) as an indicator of where storms will likely track over long timescales. An excited (relaxed) NAO is associated with higher (lower) latitude recurving (nonrecurving) storms. The Gulf (East) Coast is more susceptible to a major hurricane strike during a relaxed (excited) NAO.},

  abstract = {UK wind-power capacity is increasing and new transmission links are proposed with Norway, where hydropower dominates the electricity mix. Weather affects both these renewable resources and the demand for electricity. The dominant large-scale pattern of Euro-Atlantic atmospheric variability is the North Atlantic Oscillation (NAO), associated with positive correlations in wind, temperature and precipitation over northern Europe. The NAO's effect on wind-power and demand in the UK and Norway is examined, focussing on March when Norwegian hydropower reserves are low and the combined power system might be most susceptible to atmospheric variations. The NCEP/NCAR meteorological reanalysis dataset (1948\textendash 2010) is used to drive simple models for demand and wind-power, and `demand-net-wind' (DNW) is estimated for positive, neutral and negative NAO states. Cold, calm conditions in NAO- cause increased demand and decreased wind-power compared to other NAO states. Under a 2020 wind-power capacity scenario, the increase in DNW in NAO- relative to NAO neutral is equivalent to nearly 25\% of the present-day average rate of March Norwegian hydropower usage. As the NAO varies on long timescales (months to decades), and there is potentially some skill in monthly predictions, we argue that it is important to understand its impact on European power systems.}

  abstract = {Deconstructing causal linkages between place attributes and disaster outcomes at coarse scales like zip codes and counties is difficult because heterogeneous socio-economic characteristics operating at finer scales are masked. However, capturing detailed disaster outcomes about individuals and households for large areas can be equally complicated. This dichotomy highlights the need for a more nuanced and empirically-driven approach to understanding financial disaster recovery support. This study assessed how social characteristics influenced federal disaster recovery support following the 2015 South Carolina floods. Ordinary linear and spatial regression models provided a mechanism for pinpointing statistically significant links between individual/compound vulnerabilities and resource distribution from four federal disaster response and recovery programmes. The study makes two unique contributions. First, exploration of how social characteristics influence recovery support is a critical, yet understudied path toward fair and equitable disaster recovery. Second, finer scale inquiry across a large impact area is rare in quantitative case studies of US disasters. While we found flood recovery assistance to be strongly associated with physical damage overall the relationship was more tenuous in places with higher social vulnerability. Results indicate that future disaster recovery programs focusing on both physical damage and social vulnerable would lead to a more equitable disaster recoveries. Findings provide new understanding of equity at the intersection of social vulnerability, impacts, and disaster recovery and showcase both best-practices and areas for programme improvements for future disasters.}

Studies of the performance of RWH at the building and city scales in the U.S. are available, but a countrywide overview of the potential performance of RWH at the county scale has not been done before. Three approaches were taken: (1) assess the viability of RWH in terms of the rainfall that could be captured in relation to the water demand in each county (excluding agriculture), (2) evaluate the performance of a ``typical'' domestic RWH system across all counties with metrics related to its ability to supply the potable and nonpotable demand, and (3) evaluate the effect of adding a 50\% rainwater reuse component to the analysis. We find RWH could be a viable supplemental water source in the U.S., particularly in counties of the Pacific Northwest, Central, and Eastern regions (percent demand covered {$>$}50\%). Low population density counties have the potential to meet their annual water needs with RWH, while high-density counties could only source a small portion ( 20\%) of their annual demand with RWH. Typical RWH systems in counties in the Central and Eastern U.S. performed better than in Western counties. Adding a reuse component can be a key factor in making RWH attractive in many areas of the country. This work can inform future water infrastructure investment and planning in the U.S.},

  abstract = {This article argues that the agent-based computational model permits a distinctive approach to social science for which the term ``generative'' is suitable. In defending this terminology, features distinguishing the approach from both ``inductive'' and ``deductive'' science are given. Then, the following specific contributions to social science are discussed: The agent-based computational model is a new tool for empirical research. It offers a natural environment for the study of connectionist phenomena in social science. Agent-based modeling provides a powerful way to address certain enduring\textemdash and especially interdisciplinary\textemdash questions. It allows one to subject certain core theories\textemdash such as neoclassical microeconomics\textemdash to important types of stress (e.g., the effect of evolving preferences). It permits one to study how rules of individual behavior give rise\textemdash or ``map up''\textemdash to macroscopic regularities and organizations. In turn, one can employ laboratory behavioral research findings to select among competing agent-based (``bottom up'') models. The agent-based approach may well have the important effect of decoupling individual rationality from macroscopic equilibrium and of separating decision science from social science more generally. Agent-based modeling offers powerful new forms of hybrid theoretical-computational work; these are particularly relevant to the study of non-equilibrium systems. The agent-based approach invites the interpretation of society as a distributed computational device, and in turn the interpretation of social dynamics as a type of computation. This interpretation raises important foundational issues in social science\textemdash some related to intractability, and some to undecidability proper. Finally, since ``emergence'' figures prominently in this literature, I take up the connection between agent-based modeling and classical emergentism, criticizing the latter and arguing that the two are incompatible. \textcopyright{} 1999 John Wiley \& Sons, Inc.}

  abstract = {Planning water supply infrastructure includes identifying interventions that cost-effectively secure an acceptably reliable water supply. Climate change is a source of uncertainty for water supply developments as its impact on source yields is uncertain. Adaptability to changing future conditions is increasingly viewed as a valuable design principle of strategic water planning. Because present decisions impact a system's ability to adapt to future needs, flexibility in activating, delaying, and replacing engineering projects should be considered in least-cost water supply intervention scheduling. This is a principle of Real Options Analysis, which this paper applies to least-cost capacity expansion scheduling via multistage stochastic mathematical programming. We apply the proposed model to a real-world utility with many investment decision stages using a generalized scenario tree construction algorithm to efficiently approximate the probabilistic uncertainty. To evaluate the implementation of Real Options Analysis, the use of two metrics is proposed: the value of the stochastic solution and the expected value of perfect information that quantify the value of adopting adaptive and flexible plans, respectively. An application to London's water system demonstrates the generalized approach. The investment decisions results are a mixture of long-term and contingency schemes that are optimally chosen considering different futures. The value of the stochastic solution shows that by considering uncertainty, adaptive investment decisions avoid \textsterling 100 million net present value (NPV) cost, 15\% of the total NPV. The expected value of perfect information demonstrates that optimal delay and early decisions have \textsterling 50 million NPV, 6\% of total NPV. Sensitivity of results to the characteristics of the scenario tree and uncertainty set is assessed.}

  abstract = {This paper critically reviews the outcomes of internationally-funded interventions aimed at climate change adaptation and vulnerability reduction. It highlights how some interventions inadvertently reinforce, redistribute or create new sources of vulnerability. Four mechanisms drive these maladaptive outcomes: (i) shallow understanding of the vulnerability context; (ii) inequitable stakeholder participation in both design and implementation; (iii) a retrofitting of adaptation into existing development agendas; and (iv) a lack of critical engagement with how `adaptation success' is defined. Emerging literature shows potential avenues for overcoming the current failure of adaptation interventions to reduce vulnerability: first, shifting the terms of engagement between adaptation practitioners and the local populations participating in adaptation interventions; and second, expanding the understanding of `local' vulnerability to encompass global contexts and drivers of vulnerability. An important lesson from past adaptation interventions is that within current adaptation cum development paradigms, inequitable terms of engagement with `vulnerable' populations are reproduced and the multi-scalar processes driving vulnerability remain largely ignored. In particular, instead of designing projects to change the practices of marginalised populations, learning processes within organisations and with marginalised populations must be placed at the centre of adaptation objectives. We pose the question of whether scholarship and practice need to take a post-adaptation turn akin to post-development, by seeking a pluralism of ideas about adaptation while critically interrogating how these ideas form part of the politics of adaptation and potentially the processes (re)producing vulnerability. We caution that unless the politics of framing and of scale are explicitly tackled, transformational interventions risk having even more adverse effects on marginalised populations than current adaptation.}

  abstract = {The social cost of methane (SC-CH ) measures the economic loss of welfare caused by emitting one tonne of methane into the atmosphere. This valuation may in turn be used in cost-benefit analyses or to inform climate policies . However, current SC-CH estimates have not included key scientific findings and observational constraints. Here we estimate the SC-CH by incorporating the recent upward revision of 25 per cent to calculations of the radiative forcing of methane , combined with calibrated reduced-form global climate models and an ensemble of integrated assessment models (IAMs). Our multi-model mean estimate for the SC-CH is US\$933 per tonne of CH (5-95 per cent range, US\$471-1,570 per tonne of CH ) under a high-emissions scenario (Representative Concentration Pathway (RCP) 8.5), a 22 per cent decrease compared to estimates based on the climate uncertainty framework used by the US federal government . Our ninety-fifth percentile estimate is 51 per cent lower than the corresponding figure from the US framework. Under a low-emissions scenario (RCP 2.6), our multi-model mean decreases to US\$710 per tonne of CH . Tightened equilibrium climate sensitivity estimates paired with the effect of previously neglected relationships between uncertain parameters of the climate model lower these estimates. We also show that our SC-CH estimates are sensitive to model combinations; for example, within one IAM, different methane cycle sub-models can induce variations of approximately 20 per cent in the estimated SC-CH . But switching IAMs can more than double the estimated SC-CH . Extending our results to account for societal concerns about equity produces SC-CH estimates that differ by more than an order of magnitude between low- and high-income regions. Our central equity-weighted estimate for the USA increases to US\$8,290 per tonne of CH whereas our estimate for sub-Saharan Africa decreases to US\$134 per tonne of CH .}

  abstract = {Providing decision makers and the investment community with transparent methods to value investments in resilience and adaptation measures to protect physical assets from climate change impacts is becoming increasingly critical. To address this need, this paper introduces and utilizes the decoupled net present value (DNPV) valuation methodology. DNPV is a robust method that can incorporate climate change risk into investment analyses. This paper also discusses how the widespread use of traditional valuation methods such as net present value combined with risk-adjusted discount rates introduces a pernicious time bias effect that magnifies stakeholders' misaligned interests and investment horizons, leading investors, both public and private, to significantly underinvest in resilience and adaptation. Furthermore, because traditional valuation methods cannot correlate physical risks (e.g., loss of revenue due to physical damage or lost access to an asset) with discount rates, investments to reduce climate change risks are largely considered as expenses that make the investment less attractive. The DNPV method addresses this issue and offers a viable alternative that can consistently and transparently quantify all risks (market and non-market) in terms of cash flows. This allows investors and stakeholders to quantify in monetary terms the potential exposure of physical assets to climate-related hazards and assess the effect of decisions to invest in resilience and adaptation measures. With the aid of a simple numerical example, the DNPV method is used to illustrate how such actions can be treated as quantifiable risk reduction investment opportunities that result in better investment decisions.}

The general filter can be derived from the smoother and it is shown that the general smoother and filter solutions at the final time become identical, as is expected from linear theory. Then, a new smoother algorithm based on ensemble statistics is presented and examined in an example with the Lorenz equations. The new smoother can be computed as a sequential algorithm using only forward-in-time model integrations. It bears a strong resemblance with the ensemble Kalman filter. The difference is that every time a new dataset is available during the forward integration, an analysis is computed for all previous times up to this time. Thus, the first guess for the smoother is the ensemble Kalman filter solution, and the smoother estimate provides an improvement of this, as one would expect a smoother to do. The method is demonstrated in this paper in an intercomparison with the ensemble Kalman filter and the ensemble smoother introduced by van Leeuwen and Evensen, and it is shown to be superior in an application with the Lorenz equations. Finally, a discussion is given regarding the properties of the analysis schemes when strongly non-Gaussian distributions are used. It is shown that in these cases more sophisticated analysis schemes based on Bayesian statistics must be used.},

However, the need to address an ever-expanding range of scientific questions arising from more and more research communities has made it necessary to revise the organization of CMIP. After a long and wide community consultation, a new and more federated structure has been put in place. It consists of three major elements: (1) a handful of common experiments, the DECK (Diagnostic, Evaluation and Characterization of Klima) and CMIP historical simulations (1850\textendash near present) that will maintain continuity and help document basic characteristics of models across different phases of CMIP; (2) common standards, coordination, infrastructure, and documentation that will facilitate the distribution of model outputs and the characterization of the model ensemble; and (3) an ensemble of CMIP-Endorsed Model Intercomparison Projects (MIPs) that will be specific to a particular phase of CMIP (now CMIP6) and that will build on the DECK and CMIP historical simulations to address a large range of specific questions and fill the scientific gaps of the previous CMIP phases. The DECK and CMIP historical simulations, together with the use of CMIP data standards, will be the entry cards for models participating in CMIP. Participation in CMIP6-Endorsed MIPs by individual modelling groups will be at their own discretion and will depend on their scientific interests and priorities. With the Grand Science Challenges of the World Climate Research Programme (WCRP) as its scientific backdrop, CMIP6 will address three broad questions: {$<$}br{$><$}br{$>$} \&ndash; How does the Earth system respond to forcing?{$<$}br{$><$}br{$>$} \&ndash; What are the origins and consequences of systematic model biases? {$<$}br{$><$}br{$>$} \&ndash; How can we assess future climate changes given internal climate variability, predictability, and uncertainties in scenarios?{$<$}br{$><$}br{$>$} This CMIP6 overview paper presents the background and rationale for the new structure of CMIP, provides a detailed description of the DECK and CMIP6 historical simulations, and includes a brief introduction to the 21 CMIP6-Endorsed MIPs.{$<$}/p{$><$}/p{$>$}}

  abstract = {Recent studies identified the U.S. East Coast north of Cape Hatteras as a ``hotspot'' for accelerated sea-level rise (SLR), and the analysis presented here shows that the area is also a ``hotspot for accelerated flooding.'' The duration of minor tidal flooding [defined as 0.3 m above MHHW (mean higher high water)] has accelerated in recent years for most coastal locations from the Gulf of Maine to Florida. The average increase in annual minor flooding duration was {$\sim$}20 h from the period before 1970 to 1971\textendash 1990, and {$\sim$}50 h from 1971\textendash 1990 to 1991\textendash 2013; spatial variations in acceleration of flooding resemble the spatial variations of acceleration in sea level. The increase in minor flooding can be predicted from SLR and tidal range, but the frequency of extreme storm surge flooding events (0.9 m above MHHW) is less predictable, and affected by the North Atlantic Oscillations (NAO). The number of extreme storm surge events since 1960 oscillates with a period of {$\sim$}15 year and interannual variations in the number of storms are anticorrelated with the NAO index. With higher seas, there are also more flooding events that are unrelated to storm surges. For example, it is demonstrated that week-long flooding events in Norfolk, VA, are often related to periods of decrease in the Florida Current transport. The results indicate that previously reported connections between decadal variations in the Gulf Stream (GS) and coastal sea level may also apply to short-term variations, so flood predictions may be improved if the GS influence is considered.},

Frequently-updated ESP forecasts in a real-time SSDP reservoir system optimization model (and a simpler two-stage decision model) provide more efficient operating decisions than a sophisticated SSDP model employing historical time series coupled with snowmelt-season volume forecasts. Both models were driven by an appropriately weighted and representative subset of the original forecast and streamflow samples.}

However, in the Houston region recent events (such as the unprecedented rainfall wrought by Hurricane Harvey) have highlighted the inability of existing analyses to accurately characterize current climate conditions. Specifically, there has been little research investigating how spatial patterns of extreme precipitation have shifted through time in the Texas Gulf Coast region, which has led to mis-characterization of existing intensity\textendash duration\textendash frequency curves. This study investigates spatiotemporal trends in extreme precipitation in southeast Texas using a statistical approach for peaks-over-threshold modeling that employs a generalized Pareto distribution. Precipitation data from over 600 rain gauges across the region are analyzed in 40-year time windows to evaluate shifts in distribution parameters and extreme rainfall levels through time. Spatial analysis of these trends focuses on highlighting regions with increasing, stationary, and decreasing extreme rainfall through time. Results demonstrate heterogeneity in spatiotemporal trends across the entire study region, but significant increases in extreme rainfall over the Houston urban area. Spatial analysis of these trends focuses on how extreme rainfall has changed within different watersheds. Return level estimates of extreme rainfall values are also compared to the current standards for Harris County. Results from this study identify areas that have experienced significant shifts in extreme rainfall, and can help inform where design standards may be inaccurate or outdated.}

  abstract = {Assessing the relationship between the intensity, duration, and frequency (IDF) of extreme precipitation is required for the design of water management systems. However, when modeling sub-daily precipitation extremes, there are commonly only short observation time series available. This problem can be overcome by applying the duration-dependent formulation of the generalized extreme value (GEV) distribution which fits an IDF model with a range of durations simultaneously. The originally proposed duration-dependent GEV model exhibits a power-law-like behavior of the quantiles and takes care of a deviation from this scaling relation (curvature) for sub-hourly durations (Koutsoyiannis et al., 1998). We suggest that a more flexible model might be required to model a wide range of durations (1 min to 5 d). Therefore, we extend the model with the following two features: (i) different slopes for different quantiles (multiscaling) and (ii) the deviation from the power law for large durations (flattening), which is newly introduced in this study. Based on the quantile skill score, we investigate the performance of the resulting flexible model with respect to the benefit of the individual features (curvature, multiscaling, and flattening) with simulated and empirical data. We provide detailed information on the duration and probability ranges for which specific features or a systematic combination of features leads to improvements for stations in a case study area in the Wupper catchment (Germany). Our results show that allowing curvature or multiscaling improves the model only for very short or long durations, respectively, but leads to disadvantages in modeling the other duration ranges. In contrast, allowing flattening on average leads to an improvement for medium durations between 1 h and 1 d, without affecting other duration regimes. Overall, the new parametric form offers a flexible and enhanced performance model for consistently describing IDF relations over a wide range of durations, which has not been done before as most existing studies focus on durations longer than 1 h or day and do not address the deviation from the power law for very long durations (2\textendash 5 d).}

Mounting evidence shows that sub-daily convective rainfall extremes are increasing faster than the rate of change in the atmospheric precipitable water capacity with a warming climate. However, the response of extreme precipitation depends on the type of storm supported by the meteorological environment. Here using long-term satellite, surface radar and rain-gauge network data and atmospheric reanalyses, we show that the observed increases in springtime total and extreme rainfall in the central United States are dominated by mesoscale convective systems (MCSs), the largest type of convective storm, with increased frequency and intensity of long-lasting MCSs. A strengthening of the southerly low-level jet and its associated moisture transport in the Central/Northern Great Plains, in the overall climatology and particularly on days with long-lasting MCSs, accounts for the changes in the precipitation produced by these storms.},

In this paper, a risk evaluation method is proposed to evaluate the cascading failure risk caused by the transmission line icing. Based on the ice accretion model of the transmission line, a piecewise linear model of the transmission line failure probability considering the icing thickness is established. And the Value at Risk (VaR) and Conditional Value at Risk (CVaR) are used to evaluate the security levels of the power system threatened by icing transmission line. Simulation of an IEEE 118 system is carried out to investigate the performance of the proposed risk evaluation method. The simulation results show that the proposed method could evaluate the grid risk caused by transmission line icing. And longer icing time will result in greater cascading failure risk. Also, the cascading failure risk is affected by the position of the iced transmission line.}

  abstract = {Whether the state-of-the-art CMIP5 models have different El Ni\~no types and how the degree of modelled El Ni\~no diversity would be impacted by the future global warming are still heavily debated. In this study, the cluster analysis is used to investigate El Ni\~no diversity in 30 CMIP5 models. As the method does not rely on any prior knowledge of the patterns of El Ni\~no seen in observations, it provides a practical way to identify the degree of El Ni\~no diversity in models. Under the historical scenario, most of models show poor degree of El Ni\~no diversity in their own model world, primarily due to the lopsided numbers of events belonging to the two modeled El Ni\~no types and the weak compactness of events in each cluster. Four models are found showing significant El Ni\~no diversity, yet none of them captures the longitudinal distributions of the warming centers of the two El Ni\~no types seen in the observations. Heat budget analysis of the sea surface temperature (SST) anomaly suggests that the degree of modeled El Ni\~no diversity is highly related to the climatological zonal SST gradient over the western-central equatorial Pacific in models. As the gradient is weakened in most of models under the future high-emission scenario, the degree of modelled El Ni\~no diversity is further reduced in the future. The results indicate that a better simulation of SST gradient over the western-central equatorial Pacific might benefit a more reliable simulation/projection of El Ni\~no diversity in most CMIP5 models.}

Accurate flood flow value prediction is a huge challenge since it's influenced by both spatial and temporal relationship among flood factors. Popular deep learning structures like Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) network lacks abilities of modeling the spatial correlations of hydrological data, thus cannot yield satisfactory prediction results. Moreover, not all the temporal information is always valuable for flood forecasting. In this paper, we proposed a novel spatial and temporal aware Graph Convolution Network (ST-GCN) for flood prediction, which is capable to extract spatial-temporal information from raw flood data. Moreover, a temporal attention mechanism is introduced to weight the importance of different time steps, thus involving global temporal information to improve flood prediction accuracy. Compared with the existing methods, results on two self-collected datasets show that ST-GCN greatly improves the prediction performance.}

  abstract = {Using wavelet domain analysis and modeling of stochastic processes, we develop a unified bootstrap scheme that can be applied to both short-range dependent and long-range dependent stationary Gaussian time series. Our idea was motivated by the fact that the discrete wavelet transform is capable of converting long-range dependence in the time domain into short-range dependence in the wavelet domain. Hence we can use a simple Markov model to model the short-range dependence in the wavelet domain. The Markov model is used to generate a new version (the bootstrapped version) of the wavelet representation of the time series. The bootstrapped series is obtained by performing the inverse wavelet transform on the new wavelet representation of the original series. We compare our wavelet-based bootstrap with the moving block bootstrap for estimating the standard errors of the unit lag sample autocorrelation and the sample standard deviation. Our results show that the wavelet-based bootstrap can achieve performance better than the moving block bootstrap for both short-range dependent data and long-range dependent data.}

  abstract = {In cognitive neuroscience, computational modeling can formally adjudicate between theories and affords quantitative fits to behavioral/brain data. Pragmatically, however, the space of plausible generative models considered is dramatically limited by the set of models with known likelihood functions. For many models, the lack of a closed-form likelihood typically impedes Bayesian inference methods. As a result, standard models are evaluated for convenience, even when other models might be superior. Likelihood-free methods exist but are limited by their computational cost or their restriction to particular inference scenarios. Here, we propose neural networks that learn approximate likelihoods for arbitrary generative models, allowing fast posterior sampling with only a one-off cost for model simulations that is amortized for future inference. We show that these methods can accurately recover posterior parameter distributions for a variety of neurocognitive process models. We provide code allowing users to deploy these methods for arbitrary hierarchical model instantiations without further training.}

  abstract = {The combined effect of storm surge and wave action during severe storms in coastal regions can cause significant damage to civil infrastructures with cascading consequences to coastal communities and their residents with respect to emergency response, repair, and recovery. This coupling of natural, physical, and social systems presents an important yet relatively underexplored problem in the probabilistic risk assessment of coastal systems. Not only does coupling exist among the built and social systems triggered by natural hazard events, but a wealth of sources of uncertainties inherent in modeling these systems also renders the problem more complex. This paper presents a framework for the probabilistic risk assessment of coupled natural-physical-social systems exposed to coastal storms. It departs from traditional literature in this area by considering interconnected coastal transportation and residential building infrastructure coupled with social systems\textemdash households in this case\textemdash focusing on households failing to respond to official calls to evacuate. A holistic multihazard risk assessment framework is posed for probing these coupled systems in the face of uncertainty. New hybrid risk metrics across built and social systems are proposed, including the probability of nonconnectivity to emergency services, time loss to access emergency services, and the number of nonevacuees at risk. The concept of a hot household is developed, at which a building with nonevacuees inside experiences collapse-limit failure and is disconnected from emergency services during a storm event. The proposed framework is applied to a case study on Galveston Island, Texas, considering uncertainties in storm frequency and intensity, damage to physical infrastructure (buildings, roadways, and bridges), and evacuation decisions of the population. The resulting models offer a foundation for risk-informed decision-making to enhance the resilience of coastal communities and provide new insight into the coupled performance of natural-physical-social systems in the face of coastal storms.},

  abstract = {Energy shortage, global warming, and climate change led to an increase in the use of alternative sources of energy, with renewable energy sources (RES) playing a fundamental role in this new energetic paradigm. However, the investment costs often constitute a major barrier to their spread use. Moreover, the overall benefits of renewable energy technologies are often not well understood and consequently they are often evaluated to be not as cost effective as traditional technologies. From the moment that the energy sector started a deregulation process, with a high level of competitiveness and associated increased market uncertainty, traditional project evaluation techniques alone became insufficient to properly deal with these additional risk and uncertainty factors. The diffusion of the renewable energy technologies is also affected by this feature. The way investors evaluate their investments call now for the use of more sophisticated evaluation techniques. Real options approach can deal with these issues and, as so, began to be considered and applied for the energy sector decision aid. This approach it is now extensively widespread in evaluating investment projects in the energy sector. A large set of applications in almost all fields of energy decision making, from electricity generation technologies appraisal to policy evaluation is available in the literature. However the use of this technique in the field of RES is still limited and worth to be analysed. This paper addresses this issue. A review of the current state of the art in the application of real options approach to investments in non-renewable energy sources and RES is presented, giving perspectives for further research in this field.}

This study examines the differences in projected changes of aridity [defined as the ratio of precipitation (P) over potential evapotranspiration (PET), or P/PET] and the Palmer drought severity index (PDSI) between raw and bias-corrected GCM output for the continental United States (CONUS). For historical simulations (1950\textendash 79) the raw GCM ensemble median has a positive precipitation bias (+24\%) and negative PET bias (-7\%) compared to the bias-corrected output when averaged over CONUS with the most acute biases over the interior western United States. While both raw and bias-corrected GCM ensembles project more aridity (lower P/PET) for CONUS in the late twenty-first century (2070\textendash 99), relative enhancements in aridity were found for bias-corrected data compared to the raw GCM ensemble owing to positive precipitation and negative PET biases in the raw GCM ensemble. However, the bias-corrected GCM ensemble projects less acute decreases in summer PDSI for the southwestern United States compared to the raw GCM ensemble (from 1 to 2 PDSI units higher), stemming from biases in precipitation amount and seasonality in the raw GCM ensemble. Compared to the raw GCM ensemble, bias-corrected GCM inputs not only correct for systematic errors but also can produce high-resolution projections that are useful for impact analyses. Therefore, changes in hydroclimate metrics often appear considerably different in bias-corrected output compared to raw GCM output.}

This study compares the shallow groundwater quality (nutrients, pharmaceuticals, and hormones) downgradient of OWDS before and after Hurricane Sandy, where available, and establishes a baseline for wastewater influence on groundwater in coastal communities inundated by Hurricane Sandy. Nutrients and contaminants of emerging concern (CECs) were detected in shallow groundwater downgradient of OWDS in two settings along the New Jersey and New York coastlines: 1) a single, centralized OWDS in a park; and 2) multiple OWDS (cesspools) in low-density residential and mixed-use/medium density residential areas. The most frequently detected pharmaceuticals were lidocaine (40\%), carbamazepine (36\%), and fexofenadine, bupropion, desvenlafaxine, meprobamate, and tramadol (24\textendash 32\%). Increases in the number and total concentration of pharmaceuticals after Hurricane Sandy may reflect other factors (seasonality, usage) besides inundation, and demonstrate the importance of analyzing for a wide variety of CECs in regional studies.}

Fire season length changes were also most pronounced at the end of the century and for northern high latitudes where fire season lengths will increase by more than 20days per year. The implications from this study are that fire seasons will be more severe in future and that conventional fire management approaches may no longer be effective.}

  abstract = {Water supply infrastructure planning in groundwater-dependent regions is often challenged by uncertainty in future groundwater resource availability. Many major aquifer systems face long-term water table decline due to unsustainable withdrawals. However, many regions, especially those in the developing world, have a scarcity of groundwater data. This creates large uncertainties in groundwater resource predictions and decisions about whether to develop alternative supply sources. Developing infrastructure too soon can lead to unnecessary and expensive irreversible investments, but waiting too long can threaten water supply reliability. This study develops an adaptive infrastructure planning framework that applies Bayesian learning on groundwater observations to assess opportunities to learn about groundwater availability in the future and adapt infrastructure plans. This approach allows planners in data scarce regions to assess under what conditions a flexible infrastructure planning approach, in which initial plans are made but infrastructure development is deferred, can mitigate the risk of overbuilding infrastructure while maintaining water supply reliability in the face of uncertainty. This framework connects engineering options analysis from infrastructure planning to groundwater resources modeling. We demonstrate a proof-of-concept on a desalination planning case for the city of Riyadh, Saudi Arabia, where poor characterization of a fossil aquifer creates uncertainty in how long current groundwater resources can reliably supply demand. We find that a flexible planning approach reduces the risk of over-building infrastructure compared to a traditional static planning approach by 40\% with minimal reliability risk ({$<$}1\%). This striking result may be explained by the slow-evolving nature of groundwater decline, which provides time for planners to react, in contrast to more sudden risks such as flooding where tradeoffs between cost and reliability risk are heightened. This Bayesian approach shows promise for many civil infrastructure domains by providing a method to quantify learning in environmental modeling and assess the effectiveness of adaptive planning.}

We assessed disparities in physical health, mental health, and health care access after Hurricane Harvey among residents of the Houston?The Woodlands?Sugar Land, Texas, metropolitan statistical area (ie, Houston MSA).MethodsWe used structured survey data collected through telephone and online surveys from a population-based random sample of Houston MSA residents (n = 403) collected from November 29, 2017, through January 6, 2018. We used descriptive statistics to describe the prevalence of physical health/mental health and health care access outcomes and multivariable generalized linear models to assess disparities (eg, based on race/ethnicity, socioeconomic status, disability) in health outcomes.ResultsPhysical health problems disproportionately affected persons who did not evacuate (odds ratio [OR] = 0.41; 95\% confidence interval [CI], 0.19-0.87). Non-Hispanic black persons were more likely than non-Hispanic white persons to have posttraumatic stress (OR = 5.03; 95\% CI, 1.90-13.10), as were persons in households that experienced job loss post-Harvey (vs did not experience job loss post-Harvey; OR = 2.89; 95\% CI, 1.14-7.32) and older persons (OR = 1.04; 95\% CI, 1.01-1.06). Health care access was constrained for persons whose households lost jobs post-Harvey (vs did not lose jobs post-Harvey; OR = 2.73; 95\% CI, 1.29-5.78) and for persons with disabilities (vs without disabilities; OR = 3.19; 95\% CI, 1.37-7.45).ConclusionsOur findings underscore the need to plan for and ameliorate public health disparities resulting from climate change?related disasters, which are expected to occur with increased frequency and magnitude.}

  abstract = {This article presents results from the first statistically significant study of traffic forecasts in transportation infrastructure projects. The sample used is the largest of its kind, covering 210 projects in 14 nations worth U.S.\$59 billion. The study shows with very high statistical significance that forecasters generally do a poor job of estimating the demand for transportation infrastructure projects. For 9 out of 10 rail projects, passenger forecasts are overestimated; the average overestima-tion is 106\%. For half of all road projects, the difference between actual and forecasted traffic is more than {$\pm$}20\%. The result is substantial financial risks, which are typically ignored or downplayed by planners and decision makers to the detriment of social and economic welfare. Our data also show that forecasts have not become more accurate over the 30-year period studied, despite claims to the contrary by forecasters. The causes of inaccuracy in forecasts are different for rail and road projects, with political causes playing a larger role for rail than for road. The cure is transparency, accountability, and new forecasting methods. The challenge is to change the governance structures for forecasting and project development. Our article shows how planners may help achieve this.

For testing whether the correlation is zero, we found that Bayesian hypothesis tests outperformed significance tests based on the empirical and exact or approximate maximum likelihood estimators considered in small samples, but that all tests performed similarly for sample size 50.

This link between hydrologic and financial uncertainties, and the possibility of increased hydrologic variability in the future, suggests that hydropower producers need to begin to consider new strategies and tools for managing these financial risks. This study uses an integrated hydro-economic model of the Roanoke River Basin to characterize the financial risk faced by hydropower generators as a result of hydrologic variability, and develops several index-based financial hedging contracts intended to mitigate this risk. Several different indices are evaluated in terms of their ability to serve as the basis for effective financial contracts. Contract structures are then developed and evaluated using a 100-year simulation that describes hydropower operations in the Roanoke basin. Basis risk, contract pricing, and risk mitigation are investigated for three styles of contracts: insurance, binary, and collar. In all three cases, the contracts are shown to be capable of substantially reducing the risks of very low revenue years for costs that are a small fraction of total annual revenues (1\textendash 3\%).}

Daily fields of 500 hPa heights from the National Centers for Environmental Prediction Reanalysis are analyzed over N. America and the N.

Two effects are identified that each contribute to a slower eastward progression of Rossby waves in the upper-level flow: 1) weakened zonal winds, and 2) increased wave amplitude. These effects are particularly evident in autumn and winter consistent with sea-ice loss, but are also apparent in summer, possibly related to earlier snow melt on high-latitude land. Slower progression of upper-level waves would cause associated weather patterns in mid-latitudes to be more persistent, which may lead to an increased probability of extreme weather events that result from prolonged conditions, such as drought, flooding, cold spells, and heat waves.},

This field of research has been able to solve a wide range of complex decision-making tasks that were previously out of reach for a machine. Thus, deep RL opens up many new applications in domains such as healthcare, robotics, smart grids, finance, and many more. This manuscript provides an introduction to deep reinforcement learning models, algorithms and techniques. Particular focus is on the aspects related to generalization and how deep RL can be used for practical applications. We assume the reader is familiar with basic machine learning concepts.},

  abstract = {Flooding exacerbated by climate change has resulted in more mandatory community participation in the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) National Flood Insurance Program (NFIP). The purpose of this research is social regulatory floodplain criteria that may have an impact on various socioeconomic factors at the county and sub-county level. Updated mapping can result in widespread changes to the NFIP Special Flood Hazard Area, while no socioeconomic vulnerability assessments are completed before changes in risk designation or subsidy elimination occurs. These changes can result in additional compulsory flood insurance policies, heightened policy costs, and ultimately produce socioeconomic barriers for lower-income residents. The objectives include demonstrating the potential nationwide implications of increasing community risk with these changes to national policy through a case study from Ada County, Idaho where FEMA began updating the floodplain maps in 2015. Ada County was chosen for being reflective of other communities that may be suffering similar impacts from NFIP policy. A sequential explanatory mixed-methods approach was employed using semi-structured interviews, spatial analysis, and the Spatially Explicit Resilience-Vulnerability (SERV) model to assess potential community impacts. Results indicate increased vulnerability in the revised floodplain. Total annual sales volume, employee numbers, industry sectors, and overall community vulnerability are higher in the revised floodplain. Interviews with community leaders corroborated these results. This case study provides a foundation for further research on the impacts of flood insurance on communities across the USA while discussing the social injustice of a national program that is likely promoting the upward distribution of wealth county by county.}

  abstract = {The Gaussian process regression model is a popular type of ``emulator'' used as a fast surrogate for computationally expensive simulators (deterministic computer models). For simulators with multivariate output, common practice is to specify a separable covariance structure for the Gaussian process. Though computationally convenient, this can be too restrictive, leading to poor performance of the emulator, particularly when the different simulator outputs represent different physical quantities. Also, treating the simulator outputs as independent can lead to inappropriate representations of joint uncertainty. We develop nonseparable covariance structures for Gaussian process emulators, based on the linear model of coregionalization and convolution methods. Using two case studies, we compare the performance of these covariance structures both with standard separable covariance structures and with emulators that assume independence between the outputs. In each case study, we find that only emulators with nonseparable covariances structures have sufficient flexibility both to give good predictions and to represent joint uncertainty about the simulator outputs appropriately.

Conditional quantiles of station data (e.g., daily precipitation sums) in Germany are estimated by means of the large-scale circulation as represented by the NCEP reanalysis data. It is shown that a mixed discrete\textendash continuous response variable, such as a daily precipitation sum, can be statistically modeled by a censored variable. Furthermore, a conditional quantile skill score is formulated to assess the relative gain of a quantile forecast compared with a reference forecast. Just like multiple regression for expectation values, quantile regression provides a tool to formulate a model output statistics system for extremal quantiles.}

  abstract = {Many data analytic questions can be formulated as (noisy) optimization problems. They explicitly or implicitly involve finding simultaneous combinations of values for a set of (``input'') variables that imply unusually large (or small) values of another designated (``output'') variable. Specifically, one seeks a set of subregions of the input variable space within which the value of the output variable is considerably larger (or smaller) than its average value over the entire input domain. In addition it is usually desired that these regions be describable in an interpretable form involving simple statements (``rules'') concerning the input values. This paper presents a procedure directed towards this goal based on the notion of ``patient'' rule induction. This patient strategy is contrasted with the greedy ones used by most rule induction methods, and semi-greedy ones used by some partitioning tree techniques such as CART. Applications involving scientific and commercial data bases are presented.}

  abstract = {Estimating the probability of extreme temperature events is difficult because of limited records across time and the need to extrapolate the distributions of these events, as opposed to just the mean, to locations where observations are not available. Another related issue is the need to characterize the uncertainty in the estimated probability of extreme events at different locations. Although the tools for statistical modeling of univariate extremes are well-developed, extending these tools to model spatial extreme data is an active area of research. In this paper, in order to make inference about spatial extreme events, we introduce a new nonparametric model for extremes. We present a Dirichlet-based copula model that is a flexible alternative to parametric copula models such as the normal and t-copula. The proposed modelling approach is fitted using a Bayesian framework that allow us to take into account different sources of uncertainty in the data and models. We apply our methods to annual maximum temperature values in the east-south-central United States.}

  abstract = {Spatial and spectral approaches are two major approaches for image processing tasks such as image classification and object recognition. Among many such algorithms, convolutional neural networks (CNNs) have recently achieved significant performance improvement in many challenging tasks. Since CNNs process images directly in the spatial domain, they are essentially spatial approaches. Given that spatial and spectral approaches are known to have different characteristics, it will be interesting to incorporate a spectral approach into CNNs. We propose a novel CNN architecture, wavelet CNNs, which combines a multiresolution analysis and CNNs into one model. Our insight is that a CNN can be viewed as a limited form of a multiresolution analysis. Based on this insight, we supplement missing parts of the multiresolution analysis via wavelet transform and integrate them as additional components in the entire architecture. Wavelet CNNs allow us to utilize spectral information which is mostly lost in conventional CNNs but useful in most image processing tasks. We evaluate the practical performance of wavelet CNNs on texture classification and image annotation. The experiments show that wavelet CNNs can achieve better accuracy in both tasks than existing models while having significantly fewer parameters than conventional CNNs.},

  abstract = {The response of the Antarctic ice sheet (AIS) to changing global temperatures is a key component of sea-level projections. Current projections of the AIS contribution to sea-level changes are deeply uncertain. This deep uncertainty stems, in part, from (i) the inability of current models to fully resolve key processes and scales, (ii) the relatively sparse available data, and (iii) divergent expert assessments. One promising approach to characterizing the deep uncertainty stemming from divergent expert assessments is to combine expert assessments, observations, and simple models by coupling probabilistic inversion and Bayesian inversion. Here, we present a proof-of-concept study that uses probabilistic inversion to fuse a simple AIS model and diverse expert assessments. We demonstrate the ability of probabilistic inversion to infer joint prior probability distributions of model parameters that are consistent with expert assessments. We then confront these inferred expert priors with instrumental and paleoclimatic observational data in a Bayesian inversion. These additional constraints yield tighter hindcasts and projections. We use this approach to quantify how the deep uncertainty surrounding expert assessments affects the joint probability distributions of model parameters and future projections.}

  abstract = {Mobile and persistent chemicals that are present in urban wastewater, such as pharmaceuticals, may survive on-site or municipal wastewater treatment and post-discharge environmental processes. These pharmaceuticals have the potential to reach surface and groundwaters, essential drinking-water sources. A joint, two-phase U.S. Geological Survey-U.S. Environmental Protection Agency study examined source and treated waters from 25 drinking-water treatment plants from across the United States. Treatment plants that had probable wastewater inputs to their source waters were selected to assess the prevalence of pharmaceuticals in such source waters, and to identify which pharmaceuticals persist through drinking-water treatment. All samples were analyzed for 24 pharmaceuticals in Phase I and for 118 in Phase II. In Phase I, 11 pharmaceuticals were detected in all source-water samples, with a maximum of nine pharmaceuticals detected in any one sample. The median number of pharmaceuticals for all 25 samples was five. Quantifiable pharmaceutical detections were fewer, with a maximum of five pharmaceuticals in any one sample and a median for all samples of two. In Phase II, 47 different pharmaceuticals were detected in all source-water samples, with a maximum of 41 pharmaceuticals detected in any one sample. The median number of pharmaceuticals for all 25 samples was eight. For 37 quantifiable pharmaceuticals in Phase II, median concentrations in source water were below 113ng/L. For both Phase I and Phase II campaigns, substantially fewer pharmaceuticals were detected in treated water samples than in corresponding source-water samples. Seven different pharmaceuticals were detected in all Phase I treated water samples, with a maximum of four detections in any one sample and a median of two pharmaceuticals for all samples. In Phase II a total of 26 different pharmaceuticals were detected in all treated water samples, with a maximum of 20 pharmaceuticals detected in any one sample and a median of 2 pharmaceuticals detected for all 25 samples. Source-water type influences the presence of pharmaceuticals in source and treated water. Treatment processes appear effective in reducing concentrations of most pharmaceuticals. Pharmaceuticals more consistently persisting through treatment include carbamazepine, bupropion, cotinine, metoprolol, and lithium. Pharmaceutical concentrations and compositions from this study provide an important base data set for further sublethal, long-term exposure assessments, and for understanding potential effects of these and other contaminants of emerging concern upon human and ecosystem health.}

  abstract = {Radar-based quantitative precipitation estimate (QPE) serves as input for flood forecasting, and its importance gets magnified during catastrophic storms, e.g.,~Hurricane Harvey in 2017. The record-breaking rainfall from Hurricane Harvey covered vast spatial extents and lasted for a 5-day period, providing a unique chance for evaluating radar errors, especially their spatiotemporal dependence. Using the rainfall data of Hurricane Harvey, the authors utilize a new method for sampling ground-based rainfall measurements over radar pixels (i.e.,~spatial reference rainfall) based on subpixel rainfall variability. The new method aims to enlarge the sample size and allow for compressively evaluating the QPE. Two hourly QPE products, the Next Generation Weather Radar (NEXRAD) Stage IV and Multiradar Multisensor (MRMS), are chosen for the evaluation due to their roles in major flood forecasting activities; and a dense rain gauge network covering the whole of Harris County, Texas, provides the spatial rainfall reference in this analysis. Comparative analyses are conducted based on Hurricane Harvey and other two flood-inducing storms occurring in 2015 and 2016 over Harris County. The results imply that the Stage IV and MRMS overestimate and underestimate, respectively, the total rainfall by a small factor, while both QPEs tend to overestimate very light precipitation. In addition, the study suggests that the spatial correlation of radar error from both QPEs be described as powered exponential functions of interpixel distance. This study also includes hydrologic simulations for an urban watershed, demonstrating the importance of both the accuracy and spatial resolution of QPE in representing the mean areal precipitation (MAP) over catchments. The insight gained from this study provides guidance for further improving the QPE performance, and the new sampling approach for spatial reference rainfall can be applied to comprehensively evaluate long-term radar rainfall data.},

In subsequent decades, understanding of driving processes has improved, and new methodologies have been developed. Nonetheless, despite more than 70 studies, future SLR remains deeply uncertain. To facilitate understanding of the historical development of SLR projections and contextualize current projections, we have compiled a comprehensive database of 21st century global SLR projections. Although central estimates of 21st century global-mean SLR have been relatively consistent, the range of projected SLR has varied greatly over time. Among studies providing multiple estimates, the range of upper projections shrank from 1.3\textendash 1.8 m during the 1980s to 0.6\textendash 0.9 m in 2007, before expanding again to 0.5\textendash 2.5 m since 2013. Upper projections of SLR from individual studies are generally higher than upper projections from the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change, potentially due to differing percentile bounds or a predisposition of consensus-based approaches toward relatively conservative outcomes.},

Decision makers are faced with uncertain sea-level projections when designing a strategy for coastal adaptation. The traditional methods are often silent on tradeoffs as well as the effects of tail-area events and of potential future learning. Here we reformulate a simple sea-level rise adaptation model to address these concerns. We show that Direct Policy Search yields improved solution quality, with respect to Pareto-dominance in the objectives, over the traditional approach under uncertain sea-level rise projections and storm surge. Additionally, the new formulation produces high quality solutions with less computational demands than an intertemporal optimization approach. Our results illustrate the utility of multi-objective adaptive formulations for the example of coastal adaptation and point to wider-ranging application in climate change adaptation decision problems.}

  abstract = {Surrogate models replace computationally expensive simulations of physically-based models to obtain accurate results at a fraction of the time. These surrogate models, also known as metamodels, have been employed for analysis, control, and optimization of water distribution and urban drainage systems. With the advent of machine learning (ML), water engineers have increasingly resorted to these data-driven techniques to develop metamodels of urban water networks (UWNs). In this article, we review 31 recent articles on ML-based metamodeling of UWNs to outline the state-of-the-art of the field, identify outstanding gaps, and propose future research directions. For each article, we critically examined the purpose of the metamodel, the metamodel characteristics, and the applied case study. The review shows that current metamodels suffer several drawbacks, including (a) the curse of dimensionality, hindering implementation for large case studies; (b) black-box deterministic nature, limiting explainability and applicability; and (c) rigid architecture, preventing generalization across multiple case studies. We argue that researchers should tackle these issues by resorting to recent advancements in ML concerning inductive biases, robustness, and transferability. Recently developed neural network architectures, which extend deep learning methods to graph data structures, are preferred candidates for advancing surrogate modeling in UWNs. Furthermore, we foresee increasing efforts for complex applications where metamodels may play a fundamental role, such as uncertainty analysis and multi-objective optimization. Lastly, the development and comparison of ML-based metamodels can benefit from the availability of new benchmark datasets for urban drainage systems and realistic complex networks.},

  abstract = {Probabilistic programming promises to simplify and democratize probabilistic machine learning, but successful probabilistic programming systems require flexible, generic and efficient inference engines. In this work, we present a system called Turing for building MCMC algorithms for probabilistic programming inference. Turing has a very simple syntax and makes full use of the numerical capabilities in the Julia programming language, including all implemented probability distributions, and automatic differentiation. Turing supports a wide range of popular Monte Carlo algorithms, including Hamiltonian Monte Carlo (HMC), HMC with No-U-Turns (NUTS), Gibbs sampling, sequential Monte Carlo (SMC), and several particle MCMC (PMCMC) samplers. Most importantly, Turing inference is composable: it combines MCMC operations on subsets of variables, for example using a combination of an HMC engine and a particle Gibbs (PG) engine.  We explore several combinations of inference methods with the aim of finding approaches that are both efficient and universal, i.e. applicable to arbitrary probabilistic models. NUTS\textemdash a popular variant of HMC that adapts Hamiltonian simulation path length automatically, although quite powerful for exploring differentiable target distributions, is however not universal. We identify some failure modes for the NUTS engine, and demonstrate that composition of PG (for discrete variables) and NUTS (for continuous variables) can be useful when the NUTS engine is either not applicable, or simply does not work well. Our aim is to present Turing and its composable inference engines to the world and encourage other researchers to build on this system to help advance the field of probabilistic machine learning.}

We examine the actual role played by prior distributions in Bayesian models, and the crucial aspects of model checking and model revision, which fall outside the scope of Bayesian confirmation theory. We draw on the literature on the consistency of Bayesian updating and also on our experience of applied work in social science. Clarity about these matters should benefit not just philosophy of science, but also statistical practice. At best, the inductivist view has encouraged researchers to fit and compare models without checking them; at worst, theorists have actively discouraged practitioners from performing model checking because it does not fit into their framework.},

We argue that the words `objective' and `subjective' in statistics discourse are used in a mostly unhelpful way, and we propose to replace each of them with broader collections of attributes, with objectivity replaced by transparency, consensus, impartiality and correspondence to observable reality, and subjectivity replaced by awareness of multiple perspectives and context dependence. Together with stability, these make up a collection of virtues that we think is helpful in discussions of statistical foundations and practice. The advantage of these reformulations is that the replacement terms do not oppose each other and that they give more specific guidance about what statistical science strives to achieve. Instead of debating over whether a given statistical method is subjective or objective (or normatively debating the relative merits of subjectivity and objectivity in statistical practice), we can recognize desirable attributes such as transparency and acknowledgement of multiple perspectives as complementary goals. We demonstrate the implications of our proposal with recent applied examples from pharmacology, election polling and socio-economic stratification. The aim of the paper is to push users and developers of statistical methods towards more effective use of diverse sources of information and more open acknowledgement of assumptions and goals.}

Probabilistic programming languages make it easier to specify and fit Bayesian models, but this still leaves us with many options regarding constructing, evaluating, and using these models, along with many remaining challenges in computation. Using Bayesian inference to solve real-world problems requires not only statistical skills, subject matter knowledge, and programming, but also awareness of the decisions made in the process of data analysis. All of these aspects can be understood as part of a tangled workflow of applied Bayesian statistics. Beyond inference, the workflow also includes iterative model building, model checking, validation and troubleshooting of computational problems, model understanding, and model comparison. We review all these aspects of workflow in the context of several examples, keeping in mind that in practice we will be fitting many models for any given problem, even if only a subset of them will ultimately be relevant for our conclusions.},

By this, we are not merely making the commonplace observation that any particular threshold is arbitrary\textemdash for example, only a small change is required to move an estimate from a 5.1\% significance level to 4.9\%, thus moving it into statistical significance. Rather, we are pointing out that even large changes in significance levels can correspond to small, nonsignificant changes in the underlying quantities.The error we describe is conceptually different from other oft-cited problems\textemdash that statistical significance is not the same as practical importance, that dichotomization into significant and nonsignificant results encourages the dismissal of observed differences in favor of the usually less interesting null hypothesis of no difference, and that any particular threshold for declaring significance is arbitrary. We are troubled by all of these concerns and do not intend to minimize their importance. Rather, our goal is to bring attention to this additional error of interpretation. We illustrate with a theoretical example and two applied examples. The ubiquity of this statistical error leads us to suggest that students and practitioners be made more aware that the difference between ``significant'' and ``not significant'' is not itself statistically significant.}

We construct a new folded-noncentral-ttt family of conditionally conjugate priors for hierarchical standard deviation parameters, and then consider noninformative and weakly informative priors in this family. We use an example to illustrate serious problems with the inverse-gamma family of "noninformative" prior distributions. We suggest instead to use a uniform prior on the hierarchical standard deviation, using the half-ttt family when the number of groups is small and in other settings where a weakly informative prior is desired. We also illustrate the use of the half-ttt family for hierarchical modeling of multiple variance parameters such as arise in the analysis of variance.},

These methods, however, often manifest a key conceptual tension in prior modeling: a model encoding true prior information should be chosen without reference to the model of the measurement process, but almost all common prior modeling techniques are implicitly motivated by a reference likelihood. In this paper we resolve this apparent paradox by placing the choice of prior into the context of the entire Bayesian analysis, from inference to prediction to model evaluation.},

  abstract = {Representing unresolved moist convection in coarse-scale climate models remains one of the main bottlenecks of current climate simulations. Many of the biases present with parameterized convection are strongly reduced when convection is explicitly resolved (i.e., in cloud resolving models at high spatial resolution approximately a kilometer or so). We here present a novel approach to convective parameterization based on machine learning, using an aquaplanet with prescribed sea surface temperatures as a proof of concept. A deep neural network is trained with a superparameterized version of a climate model in which convection is resolved by thousands of embedded 2-D cloud resolving models. The machine learning representation of convection, which we call the Cloud Brain (CBRAIN), can skillfully predict many of the convective heating, moistening, and radiative features of superparameterization that are most important to climate simulation, although an unintended side effect is to reduce some of the superparameterization's inherent variance. Since as few as three months' high-frequency global training data prove sufficient to provide this skill, the approach presented here opens up a new possibility for a future class of convection parameterizations in climate models that are built ``top-down,'' that is, by learning salient features of convection from unusually explicit simulations.},

  abstract = {Satellite observations of coastal Louisiana indicate an overall land loss over recent decades, which could be attributed to climate and human-induced factors, including sea level rise (SLR). Climate-induced hydrological change (CHC) has impacted the way flood control structures are used, altering the spatiotemporal water distribution. Based on ``what-if'' scenarios, we determine relative impacts of SLR and CHC on increased flood risk over southern Louisiana and examine the role of water management, via flood control structures, in mitigating flood risk over the region. Our findings show that CHC has increased flood risk over the past 28 years. The number of affected people increases as extreme hydrological events become more exceptional. Water management reduces flood risk to urban areas and croplands, especially during exceptional hydrological events. For example, currently (i.e., 2016\textendash 2020 period), CHC-induced flooding puts an additional 73 km2 of cropland under flood risk at least half of the time (median flood event) and 65 km2 once a year (annual flood event), when compared to a past period (1993\textendash 1997). A 10- to 20-fold increase relative to SLR-induced flooding. CHC also increases population vulnerability in southern Louisiana to flooding; additional 9,900 residents currently live under flood risk at least half of the time, and that number increases to 27,400 for annual flood events. Residents vulnerable to SLR-induced flooding is lower (6,000 and 3,300 residents, respectively). Conclusions are that CHC is a major factor that should be accounted for flood resilience and that water management interventions can mitigate risks to human life and activities.}

  abstract = {Extreme rainfall can be a catastrophic trigger for natural disaster events at urban scales. However, there remains large uncertainties as to how satellite precipitation can identify these triggers at a city scale. The objective of this study is to evaluate the potential of satellite-based rainfall estimates to monitor natural disaster triggers in urban areas. Rainfall estimates from the Global Precipitation Measurement (GPM) mission are evaluated over the city of Rio de Janeiro, Brazil, where urban floods and landslides occur periodically as a result of extreme rainfall events. Two rainfall products derived from the Integrated Multi-satellite Retrievals for GPM (IMERG), the IMERG Early and IMERG Final products, are integrated into the Noah Multi-Parameterization (Noah-MP) land surface model in order to simulate the spatial and temporal dynamics of two key hydrometeorological disaster triggers across the city over the wet seasons during 2001\textendash 2019. Here, total runoff (TR) and rootzone soil moisture (RZSM) are considered as flood and landslide triggers, respectively. Ground-based observations at 33 pluviometric stations are interpolated, and the resulting rainfall fields are used in an in-situ precipitation-based simulation, considered as the reference for evaluating the IMERG-driven simulations. The evaluation is performed during the wet seasons (November-April), when average rainfall over the city is 4.4 mm/day. Results show that IMERG products show low spatial variability at the city scale, generally overestimate rainfall rates by 12\textendash 35\%, and impacts on TR and RZSM vary spatially mostly as a function of land cover and soil types. Results based on statistical and categorical metrics show that IMERG skill in detecting extreme events is moderate, with IMERG Final performing slightly better for most metrics. By analyzing two recent storms, we observe that IMERG detects mostly hourly extreme events, but underestimates rainfall rates, resulting in underestimated TR and RZSM. An evaluation of normalized time series using percentiles shows that both satellite products have significantly improved skill in detecting extreme events when compared to the evaluation using absolute values, indicating that IMERG precipitation could be potentially used as a predictor for natural disasters in urban areas.},

  abstract = {Abstract. The definitions of fractional Gaussian noise and integrated (or fractionally differenced) series are generalized, and it is shown that the two concepts are equivalent. A new estimator of the long memory parameter in these models is proposed, based on the simple linear regression of the log periodogram on a deterministic regressor. The estimator is the ordinary least squares estimator of the slope parameter in this regression, formed using only the lowest frequency ordinates of the log periodogram. Its asymptotic distribution is derived, from which it is evident that the conventional interpretation of these least squares statistics is justified in large samples. Using synthetic data the asymptotic theory proves to be reliable in samples of 50 observations or more. For three postwar monthly economic time series, the estimated integrated series model provides more reliable out-of-sample forecasts than do more conventional procedures.}

U.S. commercial buildings were reviewed to design rooftop RWH and ACH systems for one- to multi-story buildings' non-potable water demand. A life cycle inventory was compiled from the U.S. EPA's database. Nine scenarios were analyzed, including baseline RWH system, ACH system, and combinations of the two systems adapted to 4-story and 19-story commercial buildings in San Francisco and a 4-story building in Washington, DC. Normalization of 11 life cycle impact assessment categories showed that RWH systems in 4-story buildings at both locations outperformed ACH systems (45\textendash 80\% of ACH impacts) except equivalent in Evaporative Water Consumption. However, San Francisco's ACH system in 19-story building outperformed the RWH system (51\textendash 83\% of RWH impacts) due to the larger volume of ACH collection, except equivalent in Evaporative Water Consumption. For all three buildings, the combined system preformed equivalently to the better-performing option ({$\leq$}4\textendash 8\% impact difference compared to the maximum system). Sensitivity analysis of the volume of water supply and building occupancy showed impact-specific results. Local climatic conditions, rainfall, humidity, water collections and demands are important when designing building-scale RWH and ACH systems. LCA models are transferrable to other locations with variable climatic conditions for decision-making when developing and implementing on-site non-potable water systems.}

  abstract = {Precipitation is a vital pillar in the most of hydro-climatological studies. To measure its stochastic behavior, recent technological advancements have provided new sources of High-Resolution Precipitation Products (HRPPs), which could be utilized to overcome limitations of the ground measurements. However, accuracy of HRPPs is not the same in different regions and climates and therefore, should be assessed prior to any practical application. In this study, monthly datasets of ten HRPPs, known as CHIRPS, CMORPH, ERA5-Land, GPM\_3IMERGM, MSWEP V2, PERSIANN, PERSIANN-CCS, PERSIANN-CDR, TerraClimate, and TRMM\_3B43, are assessed over Central Plateau watershed located in central Iran during 2005 to 2015. Lack of previous studies as well as remarkable variations in altitude and climate of this watershed, make it a suitable region for studying spatiotemporal pattern of precipitation and evaluating HRPPs. For this purpose, two approaches are implemented; comparing the products with ground measurements and together using Triple Collocation (TC). Through the first approach, an error decomposition scheme is utilized besides the other statistical metrics to further investigate total and seasonal accuracy of the HRPPs; K\"oppen-Geiger climate classification indicators are used to assess climate-based spatial performance of the HRPPs. According to the results, most of the HRPPs underestimate and overestimate precipitation values in wetter and drier climates, respectively. Additionally, winter contributes more than any other season to the biases of the products. While GPM\_3IMERGM is the most accurate HRPP in the region with NRMSE, NSE, and KGE of 0.95, 0.62, and 0.73, respectively, PERSIANN-CCS results in the lowest accuracy with NRMSE, NSE, and KGE of 2.09, -0.82, and~-~0.02, respectively.}

  abstract = {Decision theory offers a formal approach to decision making, which is often viewed and taught as the rational way to approach managerial decisions. Half a century ago it generated high hopes of capturing and perhaps replacing intuition, and providing the ``right'' answer in practically all managerial situations. Today it seems fair to say that decision theory has not lived up to these expectations. Behavioral science provides ample evidence that managers fail to follow the dicta of decision theory, even when these are explained to them. As a result, executives often find decision theory frustrating and useless and prefer to rely on their intuition. This paper suggests that this extreme conclusion is unwarranted and calls for a re-appraisal of decision theory. We propose that it should not always be regarded as a mathematical tool that produces the answer; rather, it can be viewed as a framework for a dialog between the decision maker and the decision theorist. In one extreme, the decision theorist studies the problem and provides the ``correct'' answer. But in another, the decision theorist only challenges the decision maker's intuition and logic. In between, a whole gamut of possible dialogs exists, in which decision theory doesn't replace intuition, but supports and refines it.}

  abstract = {Rainwater harvesting (RWH) is a renewable water supply option for nonpotable use, most commonly used for landscaping irrigation. Water rights in Colorado prohibit all RWH except residential rain barrels and a pilot project program that allows centralized rainwater harvesting for new development. Development of a natural catchment creates impervious surfaces, thereby increasing runoff, with a subsequent decrease in infiltration and losses to evapotranspiration; pilot projects are allowed to harvest a volume equal to the predevelopment runoff losses that would have occurred on new impervious areas at the site. To support this administrative policy, a tool was developed for the efficient calculation of daily allowable harvest at nearly any project site in Colorado. A reliable and useful policy tool requires the incorporation of hydrologic science with widely applicable, user-friendly design, a challenging balance of rigor and accessibility that is welcomed by engineers and policymakers alike. The daily allowable harvest is determined for each soil group as a percentage of infiltrated rainfall less the groundwater return. Horton's infiltration method is used to model rainfall-runoff for a range of soil parameters (NRCS hydrologic soil groups) and precipitation events (0.25- to 25-year return periods and 15-min to 24-h durations). For most events, the percent infiltration is 90\% of the precipitation depth; this ratio decreases when precipitation exceeds the infiltration rate. Results are simplified in a spreadsheet tool for policy application, with allowable harvest rules binned by event duration and frequency. Simulations using the tool for a 2010-2017 precipitation record from Colorado's Front Range showed that RWH can supply up to 50\% of the annual demand for traditional landscaping and over 100\% of the water-smart landscaping demand.},

  abstract = {Advances in modeling and control have always played an important role in supporting water resources systems planning and management. Changes in climate and society are now introducing additional challenges for controlling these systems, motivating the emergence of complex, integrated simulation models to explore key causal relationships and dependences related to uncontrolled sources of variability. In this brief, we contribute a massively parallel implementation of the evolutionary multiobjective direct policy search method for controlling large-scale water resources systems under uncertainty. The method combines direct policy search with nonlinear approximating networks and a hierarchical parallelization of the Borg multiobjective evolutionary algorithm. This computational framework successfully identifies control policies that address both the presence of multidimensional tradeoffs and severe uncertainties in the system dynamics and policy performance. We demonstrate the approach on a challenging real-world application, represented by the optimal control of a network of four multipurpose water reservoirs in the Red River basin in Northern Vietnam, under observed and synthetically generated hydrologic conditions. Results show that the reliability of the computational framework in finding near-optimal solutions increases with the number of islands in the adopted hierarchical parallelization scheme. This setting reduces the vulnerabilities of the designed solutions to the system's uncertainty and improves the discovery of robust control policies addressing key system performance tradeoffs.}

  abstract = {Aeolian dust is rarely considered an important source for nutrients in large peatlands, which generally develop in moist regions far from the major centers of dust production. As a result, past studies assumed that the Everglades provides a classic example of an originally oligotrophic, P-limited wetland that was subsequently degraded by anthropogenic activities. However, a multiproxy sedimentary record indicates that changes in atmospheric circulation patterns produced an abrupt shift in the hydrology and dust deposition in the Everglades over the past 4,600 y. A wet climatic period with high loadings of aeolian dust prevailed before 2800 cal BP (calibrated years before present) when vegetation typical of a deep slough dominated the principal drainage outlet of the Everglades. This dust was apparently transported from distant source areas, such as the Sahara Desert, by tropical storms according to its elemental chemistry and mineralogy. A drier climatic regime with a steep decline in dustfall persisted after 2800 cal BP maintaining sawgrass vegetation at the coring site as tree islands developed nearby (and pine forests covered adjacent uplands). The marked decline in dustfall was related to corresponding declines in sedimentary phosphorus, organic nitrogen, and organic carbon, suggesting that a close relationship existed between dustfall, primary production, and possibly, vegetation patterning before the 20th century. The climatic change after 2800 cal BP was probably produced by a shift in the Bermuda High to the southeast, shunting tropical storms to the south of Florida into the Gulf of Mexico.}

  abstract = {When chemical or microbial contaminants are assessed for potential effect or possible regulation in ambient and drinking waters, a critical first step is determining if the contaminants occur and if they are at concentrations that may cause human or ecological health concerns. To this end, source and treated drinking water samples from 29 drinking water treatment plants (DWTPs) were analyzed as part of a two-phase study to determine whether chemical and microbial constituents, many of which are considered contaminants of emerging concern, were detectable in the waters. Of the 84 chemicals monitored in the 9 Phase I DWTPs, 27 were detected at least once in the source water, and 21 were detected at least once in treated drinking water. In Phase II, which was a broader and more comprehensive assessment, 247 chemical and microbial analytes were measured in 25 DWTPs, with 148 detected at least once in the source water, and 121 detected at least once in the treated drinking water. The frequency of detection was often related to the analyte's contaminant class, as pharmaceuticals and anthropogenic waste indicators tended to be infrequently detected and more easily removed during treatment, while per and polyfluoroalkyl substances and inorganic constituents were both more frequently detected and, overall, more resistant to treatment. The data collected as part of this project will be used to help inform evaluation of unregulated contaminants in surface water, groundwater, and drinking water.}

We show that useful estimates of absolute river discharge (in cubic meters per second) may be derived solely from satellite images, with no ground-based or a priori information whatsoever. The approach works owing to discovery of a characteristic scaling law uniquely fundamental to natural rivers, here termed a river's at-many-stations hydraulic geometry. A first demonstration using Landsat Thematic Mapper images over three rivers in the United States, Canada, and China yields absolute discharges agreeing to within 20\textendash 30\% of traditional in situ gauging station measurements and good tracking of flow changes over time. Within such accuracies, the door appears open for quantifying river resources globally with repeat imaging, both retroactively and henceforth into the future, with strong implications for water resource management, food security, ecosystem studies, flood forecasting, and geopolitics.},

Furthermore, AMHG was the centerpiece of an unprecedented recent methodology that successfully estimated river discharge solely from satellite imagery. Despite these important implications, AMHG has remained an empirical phenomenon without theoretical explanation. Here we provide the mathematical basis for AMHG, showing that it arises when independent AHG curves within a reach intersect near the same values of discharge and width, depth, or velocity. The strength of observed AMHG is determined by the degree of this convergence. Finally, we show that AMHG enables discharge estimation by defining a set of possible estimated discharges that often match true discharges and propose its future interpretation as a fluvial index.},

Large investments are being made toward adaptation and resilience to climate change, but many of those investments are separated from the more immediate climate-related vulnerabilities and opportunities that society faces. Information is increasingly available that could be used to guide action; however, information alone is not sufficient. Research at the International Research Institute for Climate and Society (IRI) since 1996 has led to the identification of the several guiding principles to scope and address climate-related challenges to decision- and policy-makers at local-to-regional scale. These include climate-related information, such as assessment of the main vulnerabilities to climate variability and change in countries or regions, and the provision of climate information, products and tools to support decisions, including financial tools that are appropriate to the climate-related risk and that can mediate residual risk. The guiding principles also include identifying the technologies and practices that optimize results in coming years, demonstration of the usefulness of climate information to support climate-related decisions, training and capacity building, and partnerships for research and implementation. This essay introduces the evolution of the IRI and its work that is then elaborated through a series of articles that constitute a special issue of Earth Perspectives: Transdisciplinarity Enabled. The collection of articles provides insight into the science and process that lead to better climate-informed choices. Part of the collection of articles in the special issue covers specific stories of local-to-regional engagement with partners to address climate-related problems. Other articles represent how we do what we do, in particular highlighting the research, the climate forecast effort, and the IRI Data Library. Finally, there are two papers offered from partners that have long-time engagement with the IRI.}

  abstract = {Issue Title: Climatic Change Letters | Edited by Michael Oppenheimer | pages 791-825 Anthropogenic greenhouse gas emissions are changing the Earth's climate and impose substantial risks for current and future generations. What are scientifically sound, economically viable, and ethically defendable strategies to manage these climate risks? Ratified international agreements call for a reduction of greenhouse gas emissions to avoid dangerous anthropogenic interference with the climate system. Recent proposals, however, call for a different approach: to geoengineer climate by injecting aerosol precursors into the stratosphere. Published economic studies typically neglect the risks of aerosol geoengineering due to (i) the potential for a failure to sustain the aerosol forcing and (ii) the negative impacts associated with the aerosol forcing. Here we use a simple integrated assessment model of climate change to analyze potential economic impacts of aerosol geoengineering strategies over a wide range of uncertain parameters such as climate sensitivity, the economic damages due to climate change, and the economic damages due to aerosol geoengineering forcing. The simplicity of the model provides the advantages of parsimony and transparency, but it also imposes severe caveats on the interpretation of the results. For example, the analysis is based on a globally aggregated model and is hence silent on intragenerational distribution of costs and benefits. In addition, the analysis neglects the effects of learning and has a very simplistic representation of climate change impacts. Our analysis suggests three main conclusions. First, substituting aerosol geoengineering for CO2 abatement can be an economically ineffective strategy. One key to this finding is that a failure to sustain the aerosol forcing can lead to sizeable and abrupt climatic changes. The monetary damages due to such a discontinuous aerosol geoengineering can dominate the cost-benefit analysis because the monetary damages of climate change are expected to increase with the rate of change. Second, the relative contribution of aerosol geoengineering to an economically optimal portfolio hinges critically on, thus far, deeply uncertain estimates of the damages due to aerosol forcing. Even if we assume that aerosol forcing could be deployed continuously, the aerosol geoengineering does not considerably displace CO2 abatement in the simple economic optimal growth model until the damages due to the aerosol forcing are rather low. Third, substituting aerosol geoengineering for greenhouse gas emission abatement can fail an ethical test regarding intergenerational justice. Substituting aerosol geoengineering for greenhouse gas emissions abatements constitutes a conscious risk transfer to future generations, in violation of principles of intergenerational justice which demands that present generations should not create benefits for themselves in exchange for burdens on future generations.[PUBLICATION ABSTRACT]},

  abstract = {To reduce computational complexity, macro-energy system models commonly implement reduced time-series data. For renewable energy systems dependent on seasonal storage and characterized by intermittent renewables, like wind and solar, adequacy of time-series reduction is in question. Using a capacity expansion model, we evaluate different methods for creating and implementing reduced time-series regarding loss of load and system costs. Results show that adequacy greatly depends on the length of the reduced time-series and how it is implemented into the model. Implementation as a chronological sequence with re-scaled time-steps prevents loss of load best but imposes a positive bias on seasonal storage resulting in an overestimation of system costs. Compared to chronological sequences, grouped periods require more time so solve for the same number of time-steps, because the approach requires additional variables and constraints. Overall, results suggest further efforts to improve time-series reduction and other methods for reducing computational complexity.}

  abstract = {Regionalization approaches\textemdash where utilities in close geographic proximity cooperate to manage drought risks and co-invest in new infrastructure\textemdash are increasingly necessary strategies for leveraging economies of scale to meet growing demands and navigate financial risks. However, regionalization also brings new challenges to water supply planning. Successful regionalization policies must equitably balance the interests of multiple partners while navigating power relationships between regional actors. In long-term infrastructure planning contexts, this challenge is heightened by the evolving system-state dynamics, which may be fundamentally reshaped by infrastructure investment. This work introduces Equitable, Robust, Adaptive, and Stable Deeply Uncertain Pathways (DU PathwaysERAS), an exploratory modeling framework for developing regional water supply management and infrastructure investment pathways. DU PathwaysERAS provides an integrated framework for stakeholders to evaluate the equity of policy outcomes across cooperating partners and explore regional power relationships within cooperative infrastructure policies. To capture the time-evolving dynamics of infrastructure pathways, DU PathwaysERAS features new tools to measure the adaptive capacity of pathway policies and evaluate time-evolving vulnerability. We demonstrate our framework on a six-utility water supply partnership seeking to develop cooperative infrastructure investment pathways in the Research Triangle, North Carolina. Our results indicate that commonly employed framings of robustness can have large and unintended adverse consequences for regional partnerships. Results further illustrate that regional and individual vulnerabilities are highly interdependent and emphasize the need to limit counterparty risks through carefully designed cooperative agreements. Beyond the Research Triangle, these results are broadly applicable to cooperative water supply infrastructure investment and management globally.},

  abstract = {Several statistical downscaling models have been developed in the past couple of decades to assess the hydrologic impacts of climate change by projecting the station-scale hydrological variables from large-scale atmospheric variables simulated by general circulation models (GCMs). This paper presents and compares different statistical downscaling models that use multiple linear regression (MLR), positive coefficient regression (PCR), stepwise regression (SR), and support vector machine (SVM) techniques for estimating monthly rainfall amounts in the state of Florida. Mean sea level pressure, air temperature, geopotential height, specific humidity, U wind, and V wind are used as the explanatory variables/predictors in the downscaling models. Data for these variables are obtained from the National Centers for Environmental Prediction\textendash National Center for Atmospheric Research (NCEP\textendash NCAR) reanalysis dataset and the Canadian Centre for Climate Modelling and Analysis (CCCma) Coupled Global Climate Model, version 3 (CGCM3) GCM simulations. The principal component analysis (PCA) and fuzzy c-means clustering method (FCM) are used as part of downscaling model to reduce the dimensionality of the dataset and identify the clusters in the data, respectively. Evaluation of the performances of the models using different error and statistical measures indicates that the SVM-based model performed better than all the other models in reproducing most monthly rainfall statistics at 18 sites. Output from the third-generation CGCM3 GCM for the A1B scenario was used for future projections. For the projection period 2001\textendash 10, MLR was used to relate variables at the GCM and NCEP grid scales. Use of MLR in linking the predictor variables at the GCM and NCEP grid scales yielded better reproduction of monthly rainfall statistics at most of the stations (12 out of 18) compared to those by spatial interpolation technique used in earlier studies.}

This article presents a new model that combines a systems approach with strategies for detecting the internal structure of networks, and providing flexibility and different levels of accuracy in estimating the extent of damage. The model describes networks as hierarchical structures obtained by successive clustering. Hierarchical analysis of networks provides unique insights about how damage affects performance throughout the whole infrastructure system. The model enables using information for decision-making more efficiently by generating different levels of resolution for different problems. This is illustrated using data from hurricane Ike, Texas, USA in 2008, where the primary transportation network is studied. Estimates of population affected and loss of productivity are discussed, emphasising the importance of multiple levels for assessment, and their application on fast decision-making for emergency situations.}

  abstract = {Wind power accounts for a large portion of the European energy mix (17\% of total power capacity). European power systems therefore have a significant-and growing-exposure to near-surface wind speed changes. Despite this, future changes in European wind climate remain relatively poorly studied (compared to, e.g., temperature or precipitation), and there is limited understanding of the differences shown by different general and regional circulation models (GCMs and RCMs). This study provides a step towards a process-based understanding of European wind speed changes by isolating the component associated with `large-scale' atmospheric circulation changes in the CMIP5 simulations. The component associated with the large-scale atmospheric circulation is found to explain cold season windiness projections in the free troposphere over Western Europe, with the changes reflecting the poleward shift of the North Atlantic jet. However, in most GCMs the projected wind speed changes near the surface are more negative than would be expected from the large-scale circulation alone. Thus, while the spread in CMIP5 21st century near surface wind speed projections is associated with divergent projections for the large-scale atmospheric circulation, there is a remarkably good agreement concerning a relative reduction in near-surface wind speeds. This analysis suggests that projected 21st century wind speed changes over Western Europe are the result of two distinct processes. The first is associated with changes in the large-scale atmospheric circulation, while the second is likely to be more local in its connection to the near-surface boundary layer. An improved process-based understanding of both is needed for enhancing confidence in wind-power projections on multi-decadal timescales. \textcopyright{} 2019, The Author(s).}

  abstract = {This study introduces the Interdependent Network Design Problem (INDP), concerned with defining the minimum-cost reconstruction strategy of a partially destroyed system of infrastructure networks, subject to budget, resources, and operational constraints, while considering interdependencies between them. To solve the INDP, the authors develop an efficient Mixed Integer Programming (MIP) model, which considers different types of interdependency while exploiting efficiencies from joint restoration due to colocation for the first time. The authors also propose heuristic methodologies based on simulation and the iterative use of the INDP model, to enable studying problems with additional complexity, such as accounting for uncertainty from possible disaster scenarios, or determining not only what to reconstruct but the order of reconstruction. Such methodologies enable the analysis of expected costs and performance associated to reconstruction of the system of networks, providing an effective tool for infrastructure decision makers. To exemplify the capabilities of the presented INDP-based methodologies, the authors study the process of restoration of a set of interdependent networks after hypothetical earthquakes in Shelby County, TN, United States. Results show that the INDP-based approaches that account for time-dependent recovery converge to quasi-optimal solutions in all 16 configurations studied, considering four different resource levels and four different earthquake magnitudes. Similarly, as desired in emergency response scenarios, the rate of performance recovery is high in the early reconstruction stages, recovering more than 85\% of performance in the first stage in a worst-case scenario.},

Modelers, decision makers, scientists, and other water resources stakeholders all utilize some notion of cause-and-effect to understand processes, make decisions, and infer how systems react to change. However, there are different perspectives on the meaning of causality in complex systems and, further, different frameworks and methodologies with which to detect causal interactions. We propose here that information theory (IT) provides a compelling framework for the detection of causality and discuss approaches for several levels of analyses that capture interactions that range from pairwise to multivariate in nature. We illustrate these types of analyses with an example based on weather station time series variables, in which variables may interact pairwise or jointly and on short to long time scales. In general, many unsolved or even unanticipated questions in the hydrologic sciences could benefit from this perspective.},

  abstract = {Abstract Climate and landcover change strongly shape water resources management, but understanding their joint impacts is extremely challenging. Consequently, there is limited research of their integrated effects on water supply systems, and even fewer studies that rigorously account for infrastructure investment and management interventions. We utilize eco-hydrologic modeling to generate watershed outflows under scenarios of climate and landcover change, which in turn drive modeled water utility-level decision-making for the Research Triangle region of North Carolina. In the Triangle region, landcover and climate change are both likely to increase water supply availability (reservoir inflows) individually and in tandem. However, improvements from water supply increases are not uniform across management system performance indicators of reliability, conservation implementation frequency (i.e., water use restrictions), and infrastructure investment. Utility decisions influence the impact of hydrologic change through both short-term (e.g., use restrictions, water transfers) as well as longer-term infrastructure investment actions, in some cases offsetting the beneficial effects of additional water supply. Timing and sequencing of infrastructure development are strongly sensitive to climate and land-use change as captured by their impacts on utility performance outcomes. This work underscores the need to consider adaptive management system responses and decision-relevant performance measures when determining the impacts of hydrologic change on water availability.}

  abstract = {Water managers must constantly balance investment in infrastructure upgrades to ensure reliable water supply with the affordability of water rates for consumers. As a result, trade-offs between water supply and financial objectives have become central to the long-term sustainability of utility operations. Few studies, however, have directly quantified decision-relevant financial benchmarks of water supply system adaptation. Benchmarks include debt covenants, guidelines required by creditors seeking assurance that debt will be repaid. Violation of covenant thresholds risks a downgrade of a utility's credit rating, higher interest rates on future debt, and higher costs for new infrastructure. This work introduces an exploratory modeling framework that carefully couples adaptive water supply planning with financial modeling to better track how utility budgetary decision making can adapt to infrastructure expansion and future water demand growth. Demonstrated through an evaluation of infrastructure planning for Tampa Bay Water (TBW), results showcase TBW budgetary adaptation in response to water demand growth and supply expansion, quantifying the financial implications of infrastructure planning decisions and demand growth on water rates as well as the bond covenants. This study underscores the importance of integrating dynamic and adaptive financial modeling in providing realistic decision support that addresses both supply reliability and financial stability.},

  abstract = {In the United States, fluvial flood risk is managed by the National Flood Insurance Program (NFIP), which delineates areas that have a 1\% chance of flooding each year (i.e. the 100-year floodplain). Development within and adjacent to riverine floodplains exacerbates flood losses by increasing peak discharge and runoff volume, shortening the time to peak, and altering the extent of the floodplain. This paper improves understanding of how future development can alter the 100-year floodplain in a watershed in Houston, TX through land use projection, hydrologic and hydraulic modeling, and implements a novel method for considering the impact of both regional trends in development and site-scale development policies on runoff response. The methodology presented in this paper integrates future development scenarios from a machine learning land use projection model with distributed hydrologic modeling and coupled 1D/2D unsteady hydraulic modeling to produce future floodplain estimates. Current site-scale detention requirements are represented within the hydrologic model to evaluate the regional effectiveness of these policies under future development conditions in 2050. Results indicate that the 100-year floodplain can expand by up to 12.5\% across the watershed as a result of projected development in 2050 using current stormwater mitigation policies, and the number of parcels within the floodplain can increase by up to 18.8\%. This study demonstrates how incremental land use changes can significantly alter the reality of flood risk in urbanizing watersheds, and how existing land use policies may be insufficient to mitigate impacts from future development.}

Traditionally, coastal flood risk models have only taken into account surge flooding, even though it is known that the role of rainfall-runoff is critical. There is limited understanding about the types of TC events that are capable of producing significant compounding and how site conditions at the coast affect the extent to which storm surge and rainfall-runoff interact. This study investigates a suite of historical TCs making landfall near the Cape Fear River Estuary, NC, through a loosely coupled physical modeling methodology in order to draw conclusions about the spatial and temporal patterns of storm surge and rainfall that are able to induce significant compound impacts. Results indicate that intense outer rain bands falling over inland portions of the study area can be a driver of river-surge compounding (increasing river levels by up to 0.36 m), while intense eyewall rainfall along the coast can result in localized compound impacts to coastal streams and tributaries if peak rainfall occurs near the time of peak storm tide. These localized compound impacts can result in defined interaction zones, where neither storm tide alone nor rainfall-runoff alone can fully explain the observed maximum water levels. These results provide insight about the relative timing and spatial patterns of rainfall and storm surge that are capable of inducing compound flooding during TC events.},

There is a need for supplementing physical models with efficient, probabilistic methodologies for compound flood hazard assessment that can be applied under a range of climate and environment conditions. Here we propose an extension to the joint probability optimal sampling method (JPM-OS), which has been widely used for storm surge assessment, and apply it for rainfall-surge compound hazard assessment under climate change at the catchment-scale. We utilize thousands of synthetic tropical cyclones (TCs) and physics-based models to characterize storm surge and rainfall hazards at the coast. Then we implement a Bayesian quadrature optimization approach (JPM-OS-BQ) to select a small number ({$\sim$}100) of storms, which are simulated within a high-resolution flood model to characterize the compound flood hazard. We show that the limited JPM-OS-BQ simulations can capture historical flood return levels within 0.25 m compared to a high-fidelity Monte Carlo approach. We find that the combined impact of 2100 sea-level rise (SLR) and TC climatology changes on flood hazard change in the Cape Fear Estuary, NC will increase the 100-year flood extent by 27\% and increase inundation volume by 62\%. Moreover, we show that probabilistic incorporation of SLR in the JPM-OS-BQ framework leads to different 100-year flood maps compared to using a single mean SLR projection.

  abstract = {Tropical cyclones (TCs) are drivers of extreme rainfall and surge, but the current and future TC rainfall\textendash surge joint hazard has not been well quantified. Using a physics-based approach to simulate TC rainfall and storm tides, we show drastic increases in the joint hazard from historical to projected future (SSP5\textendash 8.5) conditions. The frequency of joint extreme events (exceeding both hazards' historical 100-year levels) may increase by 7\textendash 36-fold in the southern US and 30\textendash 195-fold in the Northeast by 2100. This increase in joint hazard is induced by sea-level rise and TC climatology change; the relative contribution of TC climatology change is higher than that of sea-level rise for 96\% of the coast, largely due to rainfall increases. Increasing storm intensity and decreasing translation speed are the main TC change factors that cause higher rainfall and storm tides and up to 25\% increase in their dependence.},

  abstract = {Floodplain restoration offers an opportunity to enhance communities' resilience to flooding. However, the degree to which these interventions mitigate damages is often unknown, and identifying the best locations for implementation is a challenge. Further, the extent to which the benefits of flood mitigation are equitably distributed within communities is rarely considered in restoration projects. Here, we develop a novel framework to optimize investments in floodplain restoration that maximizes the utility of avoided damages from flood inundation for a range of budgetary constraints. We estimate the expected reduction in flood damages from restoration interventions by integrating a hydraulic flood model and an economic damage cost model. Using equity-weighted utility functions, we explicitly evaluate how the value of reduction in flood damages varies for different property owners. We demonstrate the potential of this approach in the Lewis Creek watershed, located in Vermont, USA. Under all optimal scenarios, the benefits of avoided flood damages over a 100-year time period outweigh the costs of restoration by at least 5-to-1. Floodplain restoration has the potential to reduce the present value of damages by up to \$400,000, a 5\% decrease from the baseline, at a cost of only \$75,000. We also show that the equity-weighted utility of flood mitigation increase when restoration interventions protect the lowest-income property owners, particularly those who live in mobile homes. Together, our results illuminate the importance of evaluating the distribution of benefits and costs associated with alternative restoration strategies, as well as underscore the capacity for floodplain restoration to build resilience to flooding.}

  abstract = {In June 2013, central Europe was hit by a century flood affecting the Danube and Elbe catchments after a 4 day period of heavy precipitation and causing severe human and economic loss. In this study model analysis and observational data are investigated to reveal the key atmospheric processes that caused the heavy precipitation event. The period preceding the flood was characterised by a weather regime associated with cool and unusual wet conditions resulting from repeated Rossby wave breaking (RWB). During the event a single RWB established a reversed baroclinicity in the low to mid-troposphere in central Europe with cool air trapped over the Alps and warmer air to the north. The upper-level cut-off resulting from the RWB instigated three consecutive cyclones in eastern Europe that unusually tracked westward during the days of heavy precipitation. Continuous large-scale slantwise ascent in so-called "equatorward ascending" warm conveyor belts (WCBs) associated with these cyclones is found as the key process that caused the 4 day heavy precipitation period. Fed by moisture sources from continental evapotranspiration, these WCBs unusually ascended equatorward along the southward sloping moist isentropes. Although "equatorward ascending" WCBs are climatologically rare events, they have great potential for causing high impact weather.}

  abstract = {This report explores evidence and insights from five case studies that have made significant recent progress in addressing the challenge of insuring poor smallholder farmers and pastoralists in the developing world. In India, national index insurance programmes have reached over 30 million farmers through a mandatory link with agricultural credit and strong government support. In East Africa (Kenya, Rwanda and Tanzania), the Agriculture and Climate Risk Enterprise (ACRE) has recently scaled to reach nearly 200,000 farmers, bundling index insurance with agricultural credit and farm inputs. ACRE has built on strong partnerships with regional initiatives such as M-PESA mobile banking. In Ethiopia and Senegal, the R4 Rural Resilience Initiative has scaled unsubsidized index insurance to over 20,000 poor smallholder farmers who were previously considered uninsurable, using insurance as an integral part of a comprehensive risk management portfolio. With strong public and private sector support, the Mongolia Index-Based Livestock Insurance Project (IBLIP) insures more than 15,000 nomadic herders and links commercial insurance with a government disaster safety net. Finally, the Index-Based Livestock Insurance (IBLI) project in Kenya and Ethiopia demonstrates innovative approaches to insuring poor nomadic pastoralists in challenging circumstances.  A few common features appear to have contributed to recent progress within these case studies:  explicitly targeting obstacles to improving farmer income;  integration of insurance with other development interventions;  giving farmers a voice in the design of products;  investing in local capacity; and  investing in science-based index development.  Evidence from these case studies can inform the ongoing debate about the viability of scaling up index-based insurance for vulnerable smallholder farmers in the developing world. The rapid progress observed in recent years suggests that index insurance has the potential to benefit smallholder farmers at a meaningful scale, and suggests the need to reassess arguments that lack of demand and practical implementation challenges prevent index-based insurance from being a useful tool to reduce rural poverty.}

Here, we investigate the individual and combined coastal protection services supplied by live corals on reefs, seagrass meadows, and mangrove forests during both non-storm and storm conditions, and under present and future sea-level conditions. Using idealized profiles of fringing and barrier reefs, we quantify the services supplied by these habitats using various metrics of inundation and erosion. We find that, together, live corals, seagrasses, and mangroves supply more protection services than any individual habitat or any combination of two habitats. Specifically, we find that, while mangroves are the most effective at protecting the coast under non-storm and storm conditions, live corals and seagrasses also moderate the impact of waves and storms, thereby further reducing the vulnerability of coastal regions. Also, in addition to structural differences, the amount of service supplied by habitats in our analysis is highly dependent on the geomorphic setting, habitat location and forcing conditions: live corals in the fringing reef profile supply more protection services than seagrasses; seagrasses in the barrier reef profile supply more protection services than live corals; and seagrasses, in our simulations, can even compensate for the long-term degradation of the barrier reef. Results of this study demonstrate the importance of taking integrated and place-based approaches when quantifying and managing for the coastal protection services supplied by ecosystems.}

  abstract = {{$<$}p{$><$}strong{$>$}Abstract.{$<$}/strong{$>$} The impact of climate change on water resources is usually assessed at the local scale. However, regional climate models (RCMs) are known to exhibit systematic biases in precipitation. Hence, RCM simulations need to be post-processed in order to produce reliable estimates of local scale climate. Popular post-processing approaches are based on statistical transformations, which attempt to adjust the distribution of modelled data such that it closely resembles the observed climatology. However, the diversity of suggested methods renders the selection of optimal techniques difficult and therefore there is a need for clarification. In this paper, statistical transformations for post-processing RCM output are reviewed and classified into (1) distribution derived transformations, (2) parametric transformations and (3) nonparametric transformations, each differing with respect to their underlying assumptions. A real world application, using observations of 82 precipitation stations in Norway, showed that nonparametric transformations have the highest skill in systematically reducing biases in RCM precipitation.{$<$}/p{$>$}}

Observed changes are compared with the uncertainty from natural variability and expected changes from CC scaling as a result of global mean surface temperature change. We show that increases in daily rainfall extremes are consistent with CC scaling, but are within the range of natural variability. In contrast, changes in the magnitude of hourly rainfall extremes are close to or exceed double the expected CC scaling, and are above the range of natural variability, exceeding CC\,\texttimes\,3 in the tropical region (north of 23\textdegree\,S). These continental-scale changes in extreme rainfall are not explained by changes in the El Ni\~no\textendash Southern Oscillation or changes in the seasonality of extremes. Our results indicate that CC scaling on temperature provides a severe underestimate of observed changes in hourly rainfall extremes in Australia, with implications for assessing the impacts of extreme rainfall.},

  abstract = {Uncertainty is recognized as a key issue in water resources research, among other sciences. Discussions of uncertainty typically focus on tools and techniques applied within an analysis, e.g., uncertainty quantification and model validation. But uncertainty is also addressed outside the analysis, in writing scientific publications. The language that authors use conveys their perspective of the role of uncertainty when interpreting a claim\textemdash what we call here ``framing'' the uncertainty. This article promotes awareness of uncertainty framing in four ways. (1) It proposes a typology of eighteen uncertainty frames, addressing five questions about uncertainty. (2) It describes the context in which uncertainty framing occurs. This is an interdisciplinary topic, involving philosophy of science, science studies, linguistics, rhetoric, and argumentation. (3) We analyze the use of uncertainty frames in a sample of 177 abstracts from the Water Resources Research journal in 2015. This helped develop and tentatively verify the typology, and provides a snapshot of current practice. (4) We make provocative recommendations to achieve a more influential, dynamic science. Current practice in uncertainty framing might be described as carefully considered incremental science. In addition to uncertainty quantification and degree of belief (present in {$\sim$}5\% of abstracts), uncertainty is addressed by a combination of limiting scope, deferring to further work ({$\sim$}25\%) and indicating evidence is sufficient ({$\sim$}40\%)\textemdash or uncertainty is completely ignored ({$\sim$}8\%). There is a need for public debate within our discipline to decide in what context different uncertainty frames are appropriate. Uncertainty framing cannot remain a hidden practice evaluated only by lone reviewers.},

Therefore, information on the cost of unit treatment processes potentially useful for DPR versus system capacity was reviewed, converted to constant 2012 US dollars, and synthesized in this work. A logarithmic variant of the Williams Law cost function was found applicable over orders of magnitude of system capacity, for the subject processes: activated sludge, membrane bioreactor, coagulation/flocculation, reverse osmosis, ultrafiltration, peroxone and granular activated carbon. Results are demonstrated versus 10 DPR case studies. Because economies of scale found for capital equipment are counterbalanced by distribution/collection network costs, further study of the optimal scale of distributed DPR systems is suggested.}

  abstract = {To aid California's water sector to better manage future climate extremes, we present a method for creating a regional ensemble of plausible daily future climate and streamflow scenarios that represent natural climate variability captured in a network of tree-ring chronologies, and then embed anthropogenic climate change trends within those scenarios. We use 600 years of paleo-reconstructed weather regimes to force a stochastic weather generator, which we develop for five subbasins in the San Joaquin River in the Central Valley region of California. To assess the compound effects of climate change, we create temperature series that reflect scenarios of warming and precipitation series that are scaled to reflect thermodynamically driven shifts in the daily precipitation distribution. We then use these weather scenarios to force hydrologic models for each of the San Joaquin subbasins. The paleo-forced streamflow scenarios highlight periods in the region's past that produce flood and drought extremes that surpass those in the modern record and exhibit large non-stationarity through the reconstruction. Variance decomposition is employed to characterize the contribution of natural variability and climate change to variability in decision-relevant metrics related to floods and drought. Our results show that a large portion of variability in individual subbasin and spatially compounding extreme events can be attributed to natural variability, but that anthropogenic climate changes become more influential at longer planning horizons. The joint importance of climate change and natural variability in shaping extreme floods and droughts is critical to resilient water systems planning and management in the Central Valley region.}

  abstract = {Bayes theorem provides a formal framework for combining prior and sample information for parameter estimation in the presence of measurement and structural errors. Prior knowledge, however, may not always be available or may be too vague to incorporate into a prior distribution. In such cases, a reference prior must be chosen for an objective analysis. Typically, a uniform density over the possible ranges of parameters is chosen as the reference prior. However, the validity of a uniform prior as a reference prior is seldom questioned. In this study, an information-theoretic approach is pursued to derive reference priors, and the results are compared to those obtained by using a uniform prior. Examples of estimating saturated hydraulic conductivity are presented. Priors over hydraulic conductivity obtained by using the information-theoretic approach are transformation-invariant and typically nonuniform. The choice between information-theoretic and uniform prior influences the posterior distribution of hydraulic conductivity, when sample information is small. The use of reference prior is also demonstrated through the PDG-GIUH hydrologic model, and issues of computational tractability are addressed.}

The tutorial assumes one has had at least a year of college-level calculus, some graduate level exposure to random processes, and familiarity with terms like ``closed '' and ``open. '' The focus is on the terms and ideas relevant to applied probability and information theory. There are no proofs and no exercises. Measure theory is a bit like grammar, many people communicate clearly without worrying about all the details, but the details do exist and for good reasons. There are a number of great texts that do measure theory justice. This is not one of them. Rather this is a hack way to get the basic ideas down so you can read through research papers and follow what's going on. Hopefully, you'll get curious and excited enough about the details to check out some of the references for a deeper understanding. A Something to measure First, we need something to measure. So we define a ``measurable space. '' A measurable space is a collection of events B, and the set of all outcomes {$\Omega$}, which is sometimes called the sample space. Given a collection of possible events B, why do you need to state {$\Omega$}? For one, having a sample space makes it possible to define complements of sets; if the event F {$\in$} B, then the event FC is the set of outcomes in {$\Omega$} that are disjoint from F.

  abstract = {Information relevant for most hydrologic applications cannot be obtained directly from the native-scale outputs of climate models. As a result the climate model output must be downscaled, often using statistical methods. The plethora of statistical downscaling methods requires end-users to make a selection. This work is intended to provide end-users with aid in making an informed selection. We assess four commonly used statistical downscaling methods: daily and monthly disaggregated-to-daily Bias Corrected Spatial Disaggregation (BCSDd, BCSDm), Asynchronous Regression (AR), and Bias Corrected Constructed Analog (BCCA) as applied to a continental-scale domain and a regional domain (BCCAr). These methods are applied to the NCEP/NCAR Reanalysis, as a surrogate for a climate model, to downscale precipitation to a 12 km gridded observation data set. Skill is evaluated by comparing precipitation at daily, monthly, and annual temporal resolutions at individual grid cells and at aggregated scales. BCSDd and the BCCA methods overestimate wet day fraction, and underestimate extreme events. The AR method reproduces extreme events and wet day fraction well at the grid-cell scale, but over (under) estimates extreme events (wet day fraction) at aggregated scales. BCSDm reproduces extreme events and wet day fractions well at all space and time scales, but is limited to rescaling current weather patterns. In addition, we analyze the choice of calibration data set by looking at both a 12 km and a 6 km observational data set; the 6 km observed data set has more wet days and smaller extreme events than the 12 km product, the opposite of expected scaling.},

  abstract = {Uncertainties in the rate and magnitude of sea-level rise (SLR) complicate decision making on coastal adaptation. Large uncertainty arises from potential ice mass-loss from Antarctica that could rapidly increase SLR in the second half of this century. The implications of SLR may be existential for a low-lying country like the Netherlands and warrant exploration of high-impact low-likelihood scenarios. To deal with uncertain SLR, the Netherlands has adopted an adaptive pathways plan. This paper analyzes the implications of storylines leading to extreme SLR for the current adaptive plan in the Netherlands, focusing on flood risk, fresh water resources, and coastline management. It further discusses implications for coastal adaptation in low-lying coastal zones considering timescales of adaptation including the decisions lifetime and lead-in time for preparation and implementation. We find that as sea levels rise faster and higher, sand nourishment volumes to maintain the Dutch coast may need to be up to 20 times larger than to date in 2100, storm surge barriers will need to close at increasing frequency until closed permanently, and intensified saltwater intrusion will reduce freshwater availability while the demand is rising. The expected lifetime of investments will reduce drastically. Consequently, step-wise adaptation needs to occur at an increasing frequency or with larger increments while there is still large SLR uncertainty with the risk of under- or overinvesting. Anticipating deeply uncertain, high SLR scenarios helps to enable timely adaptation and to appreciate the value of emission reduction and monitoring of the Antarctica contribution to SLR.}

  abstract = {Investment decisions about capital-intensive, long-lived infrastructure are challenging due to uncertainty about their future performance, particularly if the performance is sensitive to climate change. Such investments, like those made for water infrastructure, are rarely evaluated over their total operational lifetime, during which socio-economic and environmental changes can cause potential lock-ins and reduced options for future choices that lead to high costs to transfer to other options. We propose an economic evaluation framework to explore adaptation pathways, or sequences of strategic investments options, that can be implemented if needed due to changing conditions. A novel feature is the inclusion of ``transfer costs'' associated with a switch to alternative pathways to allow adaptive decision-making and to minimize the cost of adjustment over time. Implementing a pathway-driven approach represents a break with most institutional decision-making processes and can significantly improve decision-making under uncertainty compared to the conventional single-investment perspective. We present a case study on flood risk management in the Netherlands to show the long-term socio-economic consequences of short-term decisions by going beyond the project cycle horizon.}

  abstract = {Without adaptation, sea-level rise (SLR) will put more people at risk of flooding. This requires a timely and adequate commitment to adaptation. In this paper, we show how adaptation needs to unfold over time to manage climate-induced SLR. We use a novel scenario-neutral approach, applied globally and subsequently combined with SLR and population scenarios, to assess when, where, and how fast to adapt up to 2150. As rates of SLR accelerate, adaptation needs to occur at an increasing pace or at a larger scale. While it is certain that adaptation will be necessary, it is uncertain when and how fast. After only~{$\sim~$}0.15~m SLR relative to 2020, 1 million people need to adapt to permanent submergence and the amount of people at risk of a 100-year flood increases with 21\% to 83 million people. This would occur in the next 30 (20\textendash 45) years for RCP4.5 and within 25 (18\textendash 36) years under RCP8.5, assuming no change in protection or population. The uncertainty in timing increases with higher SLR, albeit for some impacts it can still a matter of time. Population at risk of a 100-year flood doubles after 0.75~m SLR which could occur by~{$\sim~$}2080 (2068\textendash 2088), 2100 (2085\textendash 2130), or 2150 (2115-beyond 2150) under a high-end, RCP8.5, or RCP4.5 scenario respectively. The rate, at which the risk increases, differs strongly per country. In some countries an additional 1\textendash 5~million people of the present population will be at risk of a 100-year flood within the next two decades, while others have more time to adapt but will see rapid growth of risk past 2100. Combining SLR impacts with projected population change further increases the number of people at risk of a 100-year flood by {$\sim$}13\% between 2040\textendash 2060 (under both RCP8.5-SSP5 and RCP4.5-SSP2). This can be managed through protecting, floodproofing or limiting developments in high-risk areas. A commitment to adaptation is inevitable to maintain risk at present levels. With increasing warnings of the potential for accelerated SLR due to rapid ice sheet melt, adaptation may need to happen faster and sooner than previously anticipated which can have consequences for how to adapt. Failure to acknowledge the potential and long-term (including beyond 2100) adaptation commitment in development and adaptation planning may lead to a commitment gap and subsequently expensive retrofitting of infrastructure, creation of stranded assets, and less time to adapt at greater cost. In contrast, considering the long-term adaptation commitment can support timely adaptation and alignment with other societal goals.}

  abstract = {Exploring adaptation pathways into an uncertain future can support decisionmaking in achieving sustainable water management in a changing environment. Our objective is to develop and test a method to identify such pathways by including dynamics from natural variability and the interaction between the water system and society. Present planning studies on long-term water management often use a few plausible futures for one or two projection years, ignoring the dynamic aspect of adaptation through the interaction between the water system and society. Our approach is to explore pathways using multiple realisations of transient scenarios with an Integrated Assessment Meta Model (IAMM). This paper presents the first application of the method using a hypothetical case study. The case study shows how to explore and evaluate adaptation pathways. With the pathways it is possible to identify opportunities, threats, timing and sequence of policy options, which can be used by policymakers to develop water management roadmaps into the future. By including the dynamics between the water system and society, the influence of uncertainties in both systems becomes clearer. The results show, among others, that climate variability rather than climate change appears to be important for taking decisions in water management.}

Fishery managers need to establish harvesting strategies that balance economic benefits against ecological objectives, including avoiding unintended catastrophic consequences. Our results show that classical assumptions for fisheries management can yield severe instabilities in our quantified views of socioecological tradeoffs, making their ability to inform stakeholder preferences questionable. The complex ecological interactions implied by different parameterizations of such systems yield highly complex and nonlinear dynamic properties with multiple distinct basins of attraction. We show that small changes in our deeply uncertain representations of predator-prey systems can fundamentally shift their dynamics and the validity of candidate management strategies for harvest. Insights from this study highlight the importance of ensuring models capture deep uncertainties, as well as a breadth of financial and ecological criteria when searching for robust management options for resilient fisheries.}

A comparative study on 33 instances of 18 test problems from the DTLZ, WFG, and CEC 2009 test suites demonstrates Borg meets or exceeds six state of the art MOEAs on the majority of the tested problems. The performance for each test problem is evaluated using a 1,000 point Latin hypercube sampling of each algorithm's feasible parameteri- zation space. The statistical performance of every sampled MOEA parameterization is evaluated using 50 replicate random seed trials. The Borg MOEA is not a single algorithm; instead it represents a class of algorithms whose operators are adaptively selected based on the problem. The adaptive discovery of key operators is of particular importance for benchmarking how variation operators enhance search for complex many-objective problems.}

  abstract = {This study introduces a new open source software framework to support bottom-up environmental systems planning under deep uncertainty with a focus on many-objective robust decision making (MORDM), called OpenMORDM. OpenMORDM contains two complementary components: (1) a software application programming interface (API) for connecting planning models to computational exploration tools for many-objective optimization and sensitivity-based discovery of critical deeply uncertain factors; and (2) a web-based visualization toolkit for exploring high-dimensional datasets to better understand system trade-offs, vulnerabilities, and dependencies. We demonstrate the OpenMORDM framework on a challenging environmental management test case termed the ``lake problem''. The lake problem has been used extensively in the prior environmental decision science literature and, in this study, captures the challenges posed by conflicting economic and environmental objectives, a water quality ``tipping point'' beyond which the lake may become irreversibly polluted, and multiple deeply uncertain factors that may undermine the robustness of pollution management policies. The OpenMORDM software framework enables decision makers to identify policy-relevant scenarios, quantify the trade-offs between alternative strategies in different scenarios, flexibly explore alternative definitions of robustness, and identify key system factors that should be monitored as triggers for future actions or additional planning. The web-based OpenMORDM visualization toolkit allows decision makers to easily share and visualize their datasets, with the option for analysts to extend the framework with customized scripts in the R programming language. OpenMORDM provides a platform for constructive decision support, allowing analysts and decision makers to interactively discover promising alternatives and potential vulnerabilities while balancing conflicting objectives.}

Water and environmental resources problems pose significant computational challenges due to their potential for large Pareto optimal sets, the presence of disjoint Pareto-optimal regions that arise from discrete choices, multi-modal suboptimal regions, and expensive objective function calculations. This work develops two large-scale parallel implementations of the Borg MOEA, the master\textendash slave and multi-master Borg MOEA, and applies them to a highly challenging risk-based water supply portfolio planning problem. The performance and scalability of both implementations are compared on up to 16384 processors. The multi-master Borg MOEA is shown to scale efficiently on tens of thousands of cores while dramatically improving the reliability of attaining high-quality solutions. Our results dramatically expand the scale and scope of complex environmental systems that can be addressed using many-objective evolutionary optimization.}

  abstract = {With increasing flood risk due to climate change and socioeconomic trends, governments are under pressure to continue implementing flood protection measures, such as dikes, to reduce flood risk. However, research suggests that a sole focus on government-funded flood protection leads to an adverse increase in exposure as people and economic activities tend to concentrate in protected areas. Moreover, governmental flood protection can reduce the incentive for autonomous adaptation by local households, which paradoxically results in more severe consequences if an extreme flood event occurs. This phenomenon is often referred to as the `safe development paradox' or `levee effect' and is generally not accounted for in existing flood risk models used to assess developments in future flood risk under climate change. In this study we assess the impact of extreme flood events for the European Union using a large-scale agent-based model (ABM). We quantify how the safe development paradox affects (1) population growth and the increase in exposed property values, (2) the reduction in investments to flood-proof buildings as public protection increases, and (3) the increase in potential damage should a flood occur. For this analysis, we apply an ABM that integrates the dynamic behaviour of governments and residents into a large-scale flood risk assessment framework, in which we include estimates of changing population growth. We find that the impact of extreme flood events increases considerably when governments provide high protection levels, especially in large metropolitan areas. Moreover, we demonstrate how policy that stimulates the flood-proofing of buildings can largely counteract the effects of the safe development paradox.}

  abstract = {We present the first global estimates of annual average exceedances of contemporary minor, moderate, and major flood levels under sea-level rise (SLR). Applying established methods, we show that minor flooding will occur most days worldwide under 0.7 m global SLR. Moderate flooding occurs at the same frequency under 1.0 m SLR. Local and regional differences in flood threshold elevations, tidal ranges, and non-tidal variability lead to differences in the SLR required for this chronic flooding to emerge. Lower flood thresholds, smaller tidal ranges, and larger extreme skew surges mean chronic flooding can emerge with less SLR. We discuss several implications of these findings for coastal flood hazard assessments. First, tide-driven water level variability dominates weather-driven water level variability when determining locations' propensities for frequent and chronic flooding under SLR. Second, centimeter-accurate flood threshold information is necessary to accurately estimate present and future flood hazards. Third, locations with the most frequent floods at present may not be those that have the most frequent floods under SLR. We develop the Rapid Assessment Framework for Frequent Flood Transitions under SLR (RAFFFTS) to apply these findings to locations not previously considered in global coastal flood hazard studies. RAFFFTS can robustly identify potential future tidal flooding hotspots using only 1-year observational records. We anticipate RAFFFTS will be a valuable tool for identifying locations at risk of chronic flooding under SLR, complementing existing tools for identifying changes in less frequent episodic floods.},

  abstract = {We explore the changes in wind energy resources in northern Europe using output from historical to mid-21st century CMIP6 simulations and the high-emission SSP5-8.5 scenario. This study improves upon many assumptions made in the past. First, we interpolate the winds to hub height using model-level raw data; second, we use a large ensemble of CMIP6 models; third, we consider the possible wake effects on the annual energy production of a large wind farm cluster proposed for the North Sea. The common practice of extrapolating 10\^g\texteuro\textasciimacron m wind speeds to turbine height using the power law with a constant shear exponent is often a poor approximation of the actual turbine-height wind speed. This approximation can exaggerate the future changes in wind resources and ignore possible surface roughness and atmospheric stability changes. The evaluation of the wind climatologies in the CMIP6 models over the North Sea for the historical period shows good correspondence with measurements from tall masts and three reanalysis data points for 16 of the 18 models. Some of the models run at relatively high spatial resolution are as good as the reanalyses at representing the wind climate in this region. Our results show that annual mean wind speed and wind resources in northern Europe are not particularly affected by climate change in 2031-2050 relative to 1995-2014, according to a subset of 16 models in the CMIP6 collection. However, the seasonal distribution of these resources is significantly altered. Most models agree on reductions in the future wind in summer in a band that extends from the British Isles to the Baltic Sea and on increases in winter in the southern Baltic Sea. The energy production calculations show that summer energy production in a planned large wind farm cluster in the North Sea could be reduced by a median of 6.9\% during 2031-2050 when taking into account the wind farm wakes (that accounts for -0.7\%) and the changes in air density (that account for -0.9\%). \textcopyright{} 2022 Earth System Science Data.

We use linear, univariate forward models (``proxy system models (PSMs)'') that map climate variables to proxy measurements by fitting proxy data to 2 m air temperature from gridded instrumental temperature data; the linear PSMs are then used to predict proxy values from the prior estimate. Results for the LMR are compared against six gridded instrumental temperature data sets and 25\% of the proxy records are withheld from assimilation for independent verification. Results show broad agreement with previous reconstructions of Northern Hemisphere mean 2 m air temperature, with millennial-scale cooling, a multicentennial warm period around 1000 C.E., and a cold period coincident with the Little Ice Age (circa 1450\textendash 1800 C.E.). Verification against gridded instrumental data sets during 1880\textendash 2000 C.E. reveals greatest skill in the tropics and lowest skill over Northern Hemisphere land areas. Verification against independent proxy records indicates substantial improvement relative to the model (prior) data without proxy assimilation. As an illustrative example, we present multivariate reconstructed fields for a singular event, the 1808/1809 ``mystery'' volcanic eruption, which reveal global cooling that is strongly enhanced locally due to the presence of the Pacific-North America wave pattern in the 500 hPa geopotential height field.}

  abstract = {In 2017, Hurricane Harvey caused substantial loss of life and property in the swiftly urbanizing region of Houston, TX. Now in its wake, researchers are tasked with investigating how to plan for and mitigate the impact of similar events in the future, despite expectations of increased storm intensity and frequency as well as accelerating urbanization trends. Critical to this task is the development of automated workflows for producing accurate and consistent land cover maps of sufficiently fine spatio-temporal resolution over large areas and long timespans. In this study, we developed an innovative automated classification algorithm that overcomes some of the traditional trade-offs between fine spatio-temporal resolution and extent \textendash{} to produce a multi-scene, 30m annual land cover time series characterizing 21 years of land cover dynamics in the 35,000 km2 Greater Houston area. The ensemble algorithm takes advantage of the synergistic value of employing all acceptable Landsat imagery in a given year, using aggregate votes from the posterior predictive distributions of multiple image composites to mitigate against misclassifications in any one image, and fill gaps due to missing and contaminated data, such as those from clouds and cloud shadows. The procedure is fully automated, combining adaptive signature generalization and spatio-temporal stabilization for consistency across sensors and scenes. The land cover time series is validated using independent, multi-temporal fine-resolution imagery, achieving crisp overall accuracies between 78\textendash 86\% and fuzzy overall accuracies between 91\textendash 94\%. Validated maps and corresponding areal cover estimates corroborate what census and economic data from the Greater Houston area likewise indicate: rapid growth from 1997\textendash 2017, demonstrated by the conversion of 2,040 km2 ({$\pm$} 400 km2) to developed land cover, 14\% of which resulted from the conversion of wetlands. Beyond its implications for urbanization trends in Greater Houston, this study demonstrates the potential for automated approaches to quantifying large extent, fine resolution land cover change, as well as the added value of temporally-dense time series for characterizing higher-order spatio-temporal dynamics of land cover, including periodicity, abrupt transitions, and time lags from underlying demographic and socio-economic trends.}

Many of these systems are vulnerable to the impacts of climate change such as sea level rise, river and surface water flooding, landslides, wildfires, permafrost melt, droughts, and other extreme events. We estimate that more than 200,000 km of roads are currently exposed to climate-related hazards worldwide which could increase to 237,000 km by 2050 due to climate change, without inclusion of the new highway construction that will take place in that period.}

  abstract = {This study compares two widely used approaches for robustness analysis of decision problems: the info-gap method originally developed by Ben-Haim and the robust decision making (RDM) approach originally developed by Lempert, Popper, and Bankes. The study uses each approach to evaluate alternative paths for climate-altering greenhouse gas emissions given the potential for nonlinear threshold responses in the climate system, significant uncertainty about such a threshold response and a variety of other key parameters, as well as the ability to learn about any threshold responses over time. Info-gap and RDM share many similarities. Both represent uncertainty as sets of multiple plausible futures, and both seek to identify robust strategies whose performance is insensitive to uncertainties. Yet they also exhibit important differences, as they arrange their analyses in different orders, treat losses and gains in different ways, and take different approaches to imprecise probabilistic information. The study finds that the two approaches reach similar but not identical policy recommendations and that their differing attributes raise important questions about their appropriate roles in decision support applications. The comparison not only improves understanding of these specific methods, it also suggests some broader insights into robustness approaches and a framework for comparing them.},

Risk-based decision-making and simulation models are increasingly being used to guide water resource management in England. We argue that these approaches and tools are sufficient to analyse persistence and adaptability, provided they incorporate systems' coping and recovery during and after extreme events, along with a broad framing of human, economic and environmental impacts. On the other hand, we find that transformability is not readily incorporated into risk-based decision-making and related simulation tools, as it relies, amongst other things, on the capacity of institutions to identify and implement change. In England, risk-based concepts and simulation tools provide evidence with which to quantify water supply system persistence during shocks and adaptability on a range of timescales. An historical analysis reveals the adaptability of England's water supply system in response to changing economic needs for water and societal expectations for water security, as well as external drivers including conservation of the aquatic environment and the politics of privatisation of water utilities. The frequency and impact of harmful drought events suggests a low degree of persistence. We find a potential for transformability through more strategic, national-scale assessment and planning, and setting up resilience targets that are consistent across the country. However, we also show that the system has not initiated such (potentially) transformational changes until very recently.}

  abstract = {There is growing concern that flooding is becoming more frequent and severe in Europe. A better understanding of flood regime changes and their drivers is therefore needed. The paper reviews the current knowledge on flood regime changes in European rivers that has traditionally been obtained through two alternative research approaches. The first approach is the data-based detection of changes in observed flood events. Current methods are reviewed together with their challenges and opportunities. For example, observation biases, the merging of different data sources and accounting for nonlinear drivers and responses. The second approach consists of modelled scenarios of future floods. Challenges and opportunities associated with flood change scenarios are discussed such as fully accounting for uncertainties in the modelling cascade and feedbacks. To make progress in flood change research, we suggest that a synthesis of these two approaches is needed. This can be achieved by focusing on long duration records and flood-rich and flood-poor periods rather than on short duration flood trends only, by formally attributing causes of observed flood changes, by validating scenarios against observed flood regime dynamics, and by developing low-dimensional models of flood changes and feedbacks. The paper finishes with a call for a joint European flood change research network.}

  abstract = {The goal of this study is to investigate the uncertainty of an urban sewer system's response under various rainfall and infrastructure scenarios by applying a recently developed nonparametric copula-based simulation approach to extreme rainfall fields. The approach allows for Monte Carlo simulation of multiple variables with differing marginal distributions and arbitrary dependence structure. The independent and identically distributed daily extreme rainfall events of the corresponding urban area, extracted from nationwide high resolution radar data stage IV, are the inputs of the spatial simulator. The simulated extreme rainfall fields were used to calculate excess runoff using the Natural Resources Conservation Service's approach. New York City is selected as a case study and the results highlight the importance of preserving the spatial dependence of rainfall fields between the grids, even for simplified hydrologic models. This study estimates the probability of combined sewer overflows under extreme rainfall events and identifies the most effective locations in New York City to install green infrastructure for detaining excess stormwater runoff. The results of this study are beneficial for planners working on stormwater management and the approach is broadly applicable because it does not rely on extensive sewer system information.}

  abstract = {Hydrologic variability poses an important source of financial risk for hydropower-reliant electric utilities, particularly in snow-dominated regions. Drought-related reductions in hydropower production can lead to decreased electricity sales or increased procurement costs to meet firm contractual obligations. This research contributes a methodology for characterizing the trade-offs between cash flows and debt burden for alternative financial risk management portfolios, and applies it to a hydropower producer in the Sierra Nevada mountains (San Francisco Public Utilities Commission). A newly designed financial contract, based on a snow water equivalent depth (SWE) index, provides payouts to hydropower producers in dry years in return for the producers making payments in wet years. This contract, called a capped contract for differences (CFD), is found to significantly reduce cash flow volatility and is considered within a broader risk management portfolio that also includes reserve funds and debt issuance. Our results show that solutions relying primarily on a reserve fund can manage risk at low cost but may require a utility to take on significant debt during severe droughts. More risk-averse utilities with less access to debt should combine a reserve fund with the proposed CFD instrument in order to better manage the financial losses associated with extreme droughts. Our results show that the optimal risk management strategies and resulting outcomes are strongly influenced by the utility's fixed cost burden and by CFD pricing, while interest rates are found to be less important. These results are broadly transferable to hydropower systems in snow-dominated regions facing significant revenue volatility.},

Harris County was heavily impacted with over 177,000 homes and buildings (approximately 12 percent of all buildings in the county) experiencing flooding. The objective of this study was to measure 13 heavy metals in soil in residential areas and to assess cancer and non-cancer risk for children and adults after floodwaters receded. Between September and November 2017, we collected 174 surface soil samples in 10 communities, which were classified as ``High Environmental Impact'' or ``Low Environmental Impact'' communities, based on a composite metric of six environmental parameters. A second campaign was conducted between May 2019 and July 2019 when additional 204 soil samples were collected. Concentrations of metals at both sampling campaigns were higher in High Environmental Impact communities than in Low Environmental Impact communities and there was little change in metal levels between the two sampling periods. The Pollution Indices of lead (Pb), zinc, copper, nickel, and manganese in High Environmental Impact communities were significantly higher than those in Low Environmental Impact communities. Further, cancer risk estimates in three communities for arsenic through soil ingestion were greater than 1 in 1,000,000. Although average soil Pb was lower than the benchmark of the United States Environmental Protection Agency, the hazard indices for non-cancer outcomes in three communities, mostly attributed to Pb, were greater than 1. Health risk estimates for children living in these communities were greater than those for adults.}

Forecasting models are limited by computational costs and therefore often can only make coarse resolution predictions. Statistical downscaling can provide an efficient method of upsampling low-resolution data. In this field, deep learning has been applied successfully, often using image super-resolution methods from computer vision. Despite achieving visually compelling results in some cases, such models often violate conservation laws when predicting physical variables. In order to conserve important physical quantities, we develop methods that guarantee physical constraints are satisfied by a deep downscaling model while also increasing their performance according to traditional metrics. We introduce two ways of constraining the network: A renormalization layer added to the end of the neural network and a successive approach that scales with increasing upsampling factors. We show the applicability of our methods across different popular architectures and upsampling factors using ERA5 reanalysis data.}

Study focus The future of water for the MRG and many other arid and semi-arid regions of the world is challenged by a changing climate, agricultural intensification, growing urban populations, and a segmented governance system in a transboundary setting. The core question for such settings is: how can water be managed so that competing agricultural, urban, and environmental sectors can realize a sustainable future? We synthesize results from interdisciplinary research aimed at ``water futures'', considering possible, probable, and preferable outcomes from the known drivers of change in the MRG in a stakeholder participatory mode. We accomplished this by developing and evaluating scenarios using a suite of scientifically rigorous computer models, melded with the input from diverse stakeholders. New hydrological insights for the region Under likely scenarios without significant interventions, relatively cheap and easy to access water will be depleted in about 40 years. Interventions to mitigate this outcome will be very costly. A new approach is called for based on ``adaptive cooperation'' among sectors and across jurisdictions along four important themes: information sharing, water conservation, greater development and use of alternative water sources, and new limits to water allocation/withdrawals coupled with more flexibility in uses.}

  abstract = {Despite continuous improvements, precipitation forecasts are still not as accurate and reliable as those of other meteorological variables. A major contributing factor to this is that several key processes affecting precipitation distribution and intensity occur below the resolved scale of global weather models. Generative adversarial networks (GANs) have been demonstrated by the computer vision community to be successful at super-resolution problems, i.e., learning to add fine-scale structure to coarse images. Leinonen et al. (2020) previously applied a GAN to produce ensembles of reconstructed high-resolution atmospheric fields, given coarsened input data. In this paper, we demonstrate this approach can be extended to the more challenging problem of increasing the accuracy and resolution of comparatively low-resolution input from a weather forecasting model, using high-resolution radar measurements as a "ground truth". The neural network must learn to add resolution and structure whilst accounting for non-negligible forecast error. We show that GANs and VAE-GANs can match the statistical properties of state-of-the-art pointwise post-processing methods whilst creating high-resolution, spatially coherent precipitation maps. Our model compares favourably to the best existing downscaling methods in both pixel-wise and pooled CRPS scores, power spectrum information and rank histograms (used to assess calibration). We test our models and show that they perform in a range of scenarios, including heavy rainfall.},

  abstract = {Multi-model ensemble analysis integrates information from multiple climate models into a unified projection. However, existing integration approaches based on model averaging can dilute fine-scale spatial information and incur bias from rescaling low-resolution climate models. We propose a statistical approach, called NN-GPR, using Gaussian process regression (GPR) with an infinitely wide deep neural network based covariance function. NN-GPR requires no assumptions about the relationships between models, no interpolation to a common grid, no stationarity assumptions, and automatically downscales as part of its prediction algorithm. Model experiments show that NN-GPR can be highly skillful at surface temperature and precipitation forecasting by preserving geospatial signals at multiple scales and capturing inter-annual variability. Our projections particularly show improved accuracy and uncertainty quantification skill in regions of high variability, which allows us to cheaply assess tail behavior at a 0.44\$\^\textbackslash circ\$/50 km spatial resolution without a regional climate model (RCM). Evaluations on reanalysis data and SSP245 forced climate models show that NN-GPR produces similar, overall climatologies to the model ensemble while better capturing fine scale spatial patterns. Finally, we compare NN-GPR's regional predictions against two RCMs and show that NN-GPR can rival the performance of RCMs using only global model data as input.},

  abstract = {To predict future changes in blocking and the resulting weather extremes, some studies have proposed the negative phase of Arctic Oscillation (-AO) as an analogue for Arctic amplification because of similarities between their mean states: reduced midlatitude-to-pole temperature gradients and weakened, equatorward shifted jet streams. Using well-controlled modeling experiments, we show that blocking variations associated with mean state anomalies are opposite depending on whether these anomalies are driven by the internal dynamics as in AO or forced externally as in Arctic amplification. While blocking increases and its latitudinal-distribution shifts poleward in -AO, we find opposite responses when a mean state identical to the -AO mean state is externally forced. Findings suggest that the observed blocking-AO relationship is a correlation which does not imply that the -AO mean state causes increased blocking and should not be employed as a prototype for Arctic amplification. Furthermore, results urge for a careful consideration of causality before using internal variability to predict low-frequency response to external forcings.}

Faced with growing and evolving water supply concerns, many utilities and industries have relied on nontraditional water sources to mitigate severe shortages and combat water quality concerns. Treated municipal wastewater can serve as a reliable supply of water at a predictable quality and quantity and is especially well-suited for nonpotable end uses. In this work, we identify areas within the contiguous United States where water reuse projects are possible on the basis of existing supplies of treated wastewater at known qualities and quantities, estimated nonpotable demands, and state-level policies that outline water quality requirements for reuse. We use publicly available data to develop a geographic information system-based supply-demand assessment that identifies spatial trends and areas of interest for locally focused water reuse analysis. We find that the feasibility of water reuse is highly sensitive to existing state-level policies and the level of wastewater treatment currently in place. Nonpotable recycled water can potentially offset significant water withdrawals within communities where specific policy and technical criteria are met.}

Over the last decade, observational studies have succeeded in demonstrating the scaling relationship between extreme precipitation and temperature to understand the projected changes. In mid-latitude coastal regions, intense precipitation is strongly influenced by synoptic patterns and a particular characteristic is the long-lasting heavy precipitation driven by abundant moisture transport. However, the effect of synoptic patterns on the scaling relationship remains unclear. Here we conduct an event-based analysis using long-term historical records in Japan, to distinguish extreme precipitation arising from different synoptic patterns. We find that event peak intensity increases more sharply in persistent precipitation events, which lasted more than 10\,h, sustained by atmospheric river-like circulation patterns. The long duration-accumulated precipitation extremes also increase with temperature at a rate considerably above the C-C rate at higher temperatures. Our result suggests that long-lasting precipitation events respond more to warming compared with short-duration events. This greatly increases the risks of future floods and landslides in the mid-latitude coastal regions.},

  abstract = {Global flood models (GFMs) and earth observation (EO) play a crucial role in characterising flooding, especially in data-sparse, under-resourced regions of the world. However, validation studies are often limited to a handful of historic events and do not directly assess the ability of these products to simulate flood hazard\textemdash the probability that flooding will occur in a given location. As a result, it is difficult for stakeholders to decipher the ability of either models or observations to identify flood hazard and make decisions to mitigate for flooding. Here, we leverage flood observations from 20 years of MODIS data to compare the recorded flooding with what would be expected given the hazard simulated by a GFM. We devise an approach, Flood Expectation Per Pixel, and apply it across four large basins in Africa\textemdash Congo, Niger, Nile and Volta representing a variety of biomes. We estimate the uncertainty of EO to capture flood events due to burned areas, cloud cover and vegetation, incorporating uncertainty estimates when comparing to modelled hazard. We found that at lower return periods (RPs) ({$<$}20 years), the EO data records less flooding than the GFM, suggesting GFMs overpredict frequent flooding. For RPs between 50 and 100 years, GFM and EO data show greater consistency given the uncertainties we consider. For large RPs (100 years) the EO observations show more flooding than expected given the GFM data, potentially due to data errors and non-fluvial flooding, however there are too few observations to draw significant conclusions at these RPs. The EO record indicates that the GFM can differentiate between flood RPs. We find EO and GFM complement each other and thus should be used in tandem to inform strategies to mitigate floods across the hazard spectrum from frequent to extreme flood events.}

To reduce the storage footprint and facilitate scalable post-hoc analyses of such scientific data sets, various data reduction/summarization methods have been proposed over the years. Different flavors of sampling algorithms exist to sample the high-resolution scientific data, while preserving important data properties required for subsequent analyses. However, most of these sampling algorithms are designed for univariate data and cater to post-hoc analyses of single variables. In this work, we propose a multivariate sampling strategy which preserves the original variable relationships and enables different multivariate analyses directly on the sampled data. Our proposed strategy utilizes principal component analysis to capture the variance of multivariate data and can be built on top of any existing state-of-the-art sampling algorithms for single variables. In addition, we also propose variants of different data partitioning schemes (regular and irregular) to efficiently model the local multivariate relationships. Using two real-world multivariate data sets, we demonstrate the efficacy of our proposed multivariate sampling strategy with respect to its data reduction capabilities as well as the ease of performing efficient post-hoc multivariate analyses.},

Given the uncertain costs of GI relative to other stormwater management strategies, stakeholders investing in GI need performance-analysis tools that consider the full suite of benefits and the impacts of uncertainty to help justify GI expenditures. This study provides a quantitative and comparative analysis of GI benefits, including nutrient uptake from stormwater and air pollutant deposition. Economic costs and benefits of GI are assessed using two metrics, benefit-cost ratios (BCRs) and nutrient removal costs, at three scales: household, subwatershed, and watershed scale. Results from a case study in the state of Maryland show that the costs of nutrient uptake at the subwatershed scale can be lower than those at either the watershed or household scales. Moreover, rain gardens are far more efficient in stormwater treatment at the household scale in comparison to watershed scale, for which large-scale dry or wet basins are more efficient. Using a BCR metric, smaller subwatersheds show more promise, while using a nutrient removal cost metric indicates that upstream subwatersheds are more suitable for stormwater treatment. The results also show that implementation of GI at all potential pervious locations does not necessarily increase nutrient removal costs and that self-installation of rain gardens greatly reduces nutrient removal costs. Finally, the results show that using numerous small-sized rain garden practices in front of residential buildings yields lower nutrient removal costs in comparison to permeable pavements placed in parking lots and commercial buildings.}

Although sound theory is lacking, variable selection is a popular statistical method which seemingly reduces the complexity of such models. However, in fact, variable selection often complicates analysis as it invalidates common tools of statistical inference such as P-values and confidence intervals. This is a particular problem in transplantation research where sample sizes are often only small to moderate. Furthermore, variable selection requires computer-intensive stability investigations and a particularly cautious interpretation of results. We discuss how five common misconceptions often lead to inappropriate application of variable selection.

  abstract = {Statistical models support medical research by facilitating individualized outcome prognostication conditional on independent variables or by estimating effects of risk factors adjusted for covariates. Theory of statistical models is well-established if the set of independent variables to consider is fixed and small. Hence, we can assume that effect estimates are unbiased and the usual methods for confidence interval estimation are valid. In routine work, however, it is not known a priori which covariates should be included in a model, and often we are confronted with the number of candidate variables in the range 10\textendash 30. This number is often too large to be considered in a statistical model. We provide an overview of various available variable selection methods that are based on significance or information criteria, penalized likelihood, the change-in-estimate criterion, background knowledge, or combinations thereof. These methods were usually developed in the context of a linear regression model and then transferred to more generalized linear models or models for censored survival data. Variable selection, in particular if used in explanatory modeling where effect estimates are of central interest, can compromise stability of a final model, unbiasedness of regression coefficients, and validity of p-values or confidence intervals. Therefore, we give pragmatic recommendations for the practicing statistician on application of variable selection methods in general (low-dimensional) modeling problems and on performing stability investigations and inference. We also propose some quantities based on resampling the entire variable selection process to be routinely reported by software packages offering automated variable selection algorithms.}

These systems are vulnerable to failure at all scales, posing serious threats to society, even when external shocks are absent. As the complexity and interaction strengths in our networked world increase, man-made systems can become unstable, creating uncontrollable situations even when decision-makers are well-skilled, have all data and technology at their disposal, and do their best. To make these systems manageable, a fundamental redesign is needed. A `Global Systems Science' might create the required knowledge and paradigm shift in thinking.},

  abstract = {We describe the Geophysical Fluid Dynamics Laboratory's CM4.0 physical climate model, with emphasis on those aspects that may be of particular importance to users of this model and its simulations. The model is built with the AM4.0/LM4.0 atmosphere/land model and OM4.0 ocean model. Topics include the rationale for key choices made in the model formulation, the stability as well as drift of the preindustrial control simulation, and comparison of key aspects of the historical simulations with observations from recent decades. Notable achievements include the relatively small biases in seasonal spatial patterns of top-of-atmosphere fluxes, surface temperature, and precipitation; reduced double Intertropical Convergence Zone bias; dramatically improved representation of ocean boundary currents; a high-quality simulation of climatological Arctic sea ice extent and its recent decline; and excellent simulation of the El Ni\~no-Southern Oscillation spectrum and structure. Areas of concern include inadequate deep convection in the Nordic Seas; an inaccurate Antarctic sea ice simulation; precipitation and wind composites still affected by the equatorial cold tongue bias; muted variability in the Atlantic Meridional Overturning Circulation; strong 100 year quasiperiodicity in Southern Ocean ventilation; and a lack of historical warming before 1990 and too rapid warming thereafter due to high climate sensitivity and strong aerosol forcing, in contrast to the observational record. Overall, CM4.0 scores very well in its fidelity against observations compared to the Coupled Model Intercomparison Project Phase 5 generation in terms of both mean state and modes of variability and should prove a valuable new addition for analysis across a broad array of applications.}

  abstract = {Convergence research is driven by specific and compelling problems and requires deep integration across disciplines. The potential of convergence research is widely recognized, but questions remain about how to design, facilitate, and assess such research. Here we analyze a seven-year, twelve-million-dollar convergence project on sustainable climate risk management to answer two questions. First, what is the impact of a project-level emphasis on the values that motivate and tie convergence research to the compelling problems? Second, how does participation in convergence projects shape the research of postdoctoral scholars who are still in the process of establishing themselves professionally? We use an interview-based approach to characterize what the project specifically enabled in each participant's research. We find that (a) the project pushed participants' research into better alignment with the motivating concept of convergence research and that this effect was stronger for postdoctoral scholars than for more senior faculty. (b) Postdocs' self-assessed understanding of key project themes, however, appears unconnected to metrics of project participation, raising questions about training and integration. Regarding values, (c) the project enabled heightened attention to values in the research of a large minority of participants. (d) Participants strongly believe in the importance of explicitly reflecting on values that motivate and pervade scientific research, but they question their own understanding of how to put value-focused science into practice. This mismatch of perceived importance with poor understanding highlights an unmet need in the practice of convergence science.}

Because doing so requires running the model many times over, and because computing resources are finite, uncertainty assessment is more feasible using models that demand less computer processor time. Such models are generally simpler in the sense of being more idealized, or less realistic. So modelers face a trade-off between realism and uncertainty quantification. Seeing this trade-off for the important epistemic issue that it is requires a shift in perspective from the established simplicity literature in philosophy of science.}

  abstract = {The capacities of our infrastructure systems to respond to volatile, uncertain, and increasingly complex environments are increasingly recognized as vital for resilience. Pervasive across infrastructure literature and discourse are the concepts of centralized, decentralized, and distributed systems, and there appears to be growing interest in how these configurations support or hinder adaptive and transformative capacities towards resilience. There does not appear to be a concerted effort to align how these concepts are used, and what different configurations mean for infrastructure systems. This is problematic because how infrastructure are structured and governed directly affects their capabilities to respond to increasing complexity. We review framings of centralization, decentralization, and distributed (referred to collectively as de/centralization) across infrastructure sectors, revealing incommensurate usage leading to polysemous framings. De/centralized networks are often characterized by proximity to resources, capacity of distribution, volume of product, and number of connections. De/centralization of governance within infrastructure sectors is characterized by the number of actors who hold decision-making power. Notably, governance structures are often overlooked in infrastructure de/centralization literature. Next, we describe how de/centralization concepts are applied to emerging resilient infrastructure theory, identifying conditions under which they support resilience principles. While centralized systems are dominant in practice and decentralized systems are promoted in resilience literature, all three configurations\textemdash centralized, decentralized, and distributed\textemdash were found to align with resilience capacities in various contexts of stability and instability. Going forward, we recommend a multi-dimensional framing of de/centralization through a network-governance perspective where capabilities to shift between stability and instability are paramount and information is a critical mediator.}

  abstract = {PrefaceThis book began as class notes for a course we teach on applied statistical methods to hydrologists of the Water Resources Division, U. S. Geological Survey (USGS). It reflects our attempts to teach statistical methods which are appropriate for analysis of water resources data. As interest in this course has grown outside of the USGS, incentive grew to develop the material into a textbook. The topics covered are those we feel are of greatest usefulness to the practicing water resources scientist. Yet all topics can be directly applied to many other types of environmental data.This book is not a stand-alone text on statistics, or a text on statistical hydrology. For example, in addition to this material we use a textbook on introductory statistics in the USGS training course. As a consequence, discussions of topics such as probability theory required in a general statistics textbook will not be found here. Derivations of most equations are not presented. Important tables included in all general statistics texts, such as quantiles of the normal distribution, are not found here. Neither are details of how statistical distributions should be fitted to flood data -- these are adequately covered in numerous books on statistical hydrology.We have instead chosen to emphasize topics not always found in introductory statistics textbooks, and often not adequately covered in statistical textbooks for scientists and engineers. Tables included here, for example, are those found more often in books on nonparametric statistics than in books likely to have been used in college courses for engineers. This book points the environmental and water resources scientist to robust and nonparametric statistics, and to exploratory data analysis. We believe that the characteristics of environmental (and perhaps most other 'real') data drive analysis methods towards use of robust and nonparametric methods.Exercises are included at the end of chapters. In our course, students compute each type of analysis (t-test, regression, etc.) the first time by hand. We choose the smaller, simpler examples for hand computation. In this way the mechanics of the process are fully understood, and computer software is seen as less mysterious.We wish to acknowledge and thank several other scientists at the U. S. Geological Survey for contributing ideas to this book. In particular, we thank those who have served as the other instructors at the USGS training course. Ed Gilroy has critiqued and improved much of the material found in this book. Tim Cohn has contributed in several areas, particularly to the sections on bias correction in regression, and methods for data below the reporting limit. Richard Alexander has added to the trend analysis chapter, and Charles Crawford has contributed ideas for regression and ANOVA. Their work has undoubtedly made its way into this book}

  abstract = {120 years or more of unsustainable urban development has damaged the natural environment and disrupted essential ways to stabilize water body overflow and even mitigate pluvial flooding. In light of catastrophic flooding that has occurred globally, a renewed commitment to transforming built surfaces and incorporating more green infrastructures (GIs) has emerged. In fact, one could argue that an overcommitment to GI is being touted in the literature, but largely disconnected from more real-world possibilities, considering all things. In this commentary, we make the case that as cities transition from development patterns of the past and even considering climate-induced storm characteristics of the future, a hybridized solution (e.g., Green\textendash Gray) should be considered. Smaller approaches to urban greening have been implemented in areas that need larger-scale restorations, thus proving to be insufficient. Likewise, the uncertainty surrounding rainfall and storm events has forced us to be more strategically balanced in our efforts to achieve resilience in our stormwater infrastructure. Hybridized solutions that include a diverse set of systems, anchored in local conditions, position us best for effective urban stormwater management. In the absence of such solutions, runoff volumes will continue to rise, flooding will prevail, and disenfranchised communities will remain disproportionately impacted by these impacts of urbanization.}

Two distinct regimes of lower tropospheric winds (westerlies and easterlies) were observed in Rondonia during the Wet Season Atmospheric Mesoscale Campaign (WETAMC) component of the Large-Scale Atmosphere-Biosphere Experiment in Amazonia (LBA) and the Tropical Rainfall Measuring Mission (TRMM) field campaign. The westerly (easterly) winds were associated with strong (weak) convective activity over the South Atlantic Convergence Zone (SACZ). The period of this study (January and February of 1999) was divided into SACZ and no SACZ (NSACZ) regimes. The vertically integrated moisture fluxes over South America obtained from the National Aeronautics and Space Administration/Goddard Data Assimilation Office (NASA/DAO) assimilation system show that during the SACZ (NSACZ) period, strong (weak) convergence occurred over the Amazon basin with divergence (convergence) over southwestern Brazil, northern Argentina, and Paraguay. These moisture budgets also indicated that moisture transport from the tropics to the extratropics in the South American sector occurs more efficiently during the SACZ regime than during the NSACZ regime.}

  abstract = {Climate change introduces substantial uncertainty to water resources planning, and raises the key question: when, or under what conditions, should adaptation occur? A number of recent studies aim to identify policies mapping future observations to actions\textemdash in other words, framing climate adaptation as an optimal control problem. This paper uses the control paradigm to review and classify recent dynamic planning studies according to their approaches to uncertainty characterization, policy structure, and solution methods. We propose a set of research gaps and opportunities in this area centered on the challenge of characterizing uncertainty, which prevents the unambiguous application of control methods to this problem. These include: exogenous uncertainty in forcing, model structure, and parameters propagated through a chain of climate and hydrologic models; endogenous uncertainty in human-environmental system dynamics across multiple scales; and sampling uncertainty due to the finite length of historical observations and future projections. Recognizing these challenges, several opportunities exist to improve the use of control methods for climate adaptation, namely: how problem context and understanding of climate processes might assist with uncertainty quantification and experimental design; out-of-sample validation and robustness of optimized adaptation policies; and monitoring and data assimilation, including trend detection, Bayesian inference, and indicator variable selection. We conclude with a summary of recommendations for dynamic water resources planning under climate change through the lens of optimal control.},

  abstract = {Water resources systems face irreducible uncertainty in supply and demand, requiring policies to respond to changing conditions on multiple timescales. For both short-term operation and long-term adaptation, thresholds or ``decision triggers'', where a policy links observed indicators to actions, have featured prominently in recent studies. There remains a need for a general method to conceptualize threshold-based policies in an easily interpretable structure, and a corresponding search algorithm to design them. Here we propose a conceptual and computational framework where policies are formulated as binary trees, using a simulation-optimization approach. Folsom Reservoir, California serves as an illustrative case study, where policies define the thresholds triggering flood control and conservation actions. Candidate operating rules are generated across an ensemble of climate scenarios, incorporating indicator variables describing longer-term climate shifts to investigate opportunities for adaptation. Policy tree optimization and corresponding open-source software provide a generalizable, interpretable approach to policy design under uncertainty.}

We present a novel nonhomogeneous hidden Markov model (NHMM) for studying the underlying dynamics of sea surface temperature anomalies (SSTA) over the region 15\textdegree N\textendash 15\textdegree S, 150\textdegree E\textendash 80\textdegree W from January 1856 to December 2019, using the monthly SSTA data from the Kaplan extended SST v2 product. This nonparametric machine learning scheme dynamically simulates and predicts the spatiotemporal evolution of ENSO patterns, including their asymmetry, long-term trends, persistence, and seasonal evolution. The model identifies five hidden states whose spatial SSTA patterns are similar to the so-called ENSO flavors in the literature. From the fitted NHMM, the model shows that there are systematic trends in the frequency and persistence of the regimes over the last 160 years that may be related to changes in the mean state of basin temperature and/or global warming. We evaluated the ability of NHMM to make out-of-sample probabilistic predictions of the spatial structure of temperature anomalies for the period 1995\textendash 2016 using a training period from January 1856 to December 1994. The results show that NHMMs can simulate the behavior of the Ni\~no-3.4 and Ni\~no-1.2 regions quite well. The NHMM results over this period are comparable or superior to the commonly available ENSO prediction models, with the additional advantage of directly providing insights as to the space patterns, seasonal, and longer-term trends of the SSTA in the equatorial Pacific region.{$<$}/p{$><$}/section{$>$}},

  abstract = {Within the Copernicus Climate Change Service (C3S), ECMWF is producing the ERA5 reanalysis which, once completed, will embody a detailed record of the global atmosphere, land surface and ocean waves from 1950 onwards. This new reanalysis replaces the ERA-Interim reanalysis (spanning 1979 onwards) which was started in 2006. ERA5 is based on the Integrated Forecasting System (IFS) Cy41r2 which was operational in 2016. ERA5 thus benefits from a decade of developments in model physics, core dynamics and data assimilation. In addition to a significantly enhanced horizontal resolution of 31 km, compared to 80 km for ERA-Interim, ERA5 has hourly output throughout, and an uncertainty estimate from an ensemble (3-hourly at half the horizontal resolution). This paper describes the general set-up of ERA5, as well as a basic evaluation of characteristics and performance, with a focus on the dataset from 1979 onwards which is currently publicly available. Re-forecasts from ERA5 analyses show a gain of up to one day in skill with respect to ERA-Interim. Comparison with radiosonde and PILOT data prior to assimilation shows an improved fit for temperature, wind and humidity in the troposphere, but not the stratosphere. A comparison with independent buoy data shows a much improved fit for ocean wave height. The uncertainty estimate reflects the evolution of the observing systems used in ERA5. The enhanced temporal and spatial resolution allows for a detailed evolution of weather systems. For precipitation, global-mean correlation with monthly-mean GPCP data is increased from 67\% to 77\%. In general, low-frequency variability is found to be well represented and from 10 hPa downwards general patterns of anomalies in temperature match those from the ERA-Interim, MERRA-2 and JRA-55 reanalyses.},

In turn, residential water costs from municipal utilities are predicted to rise to unaffordable rates for poor residential water customers. Building on a regional conjunctive use model with future climate scenarios and 50-year future water supply plans, our study communicates the effects of climate change on poor people in El Paso, Texas, as water becomes more difficult and expensive to obtain in future years. Four scenarios for future water supply and future water costs were delineated based on expected impacts of climate change and groundwater depletion. Residential water use was calculated by census tract in El Paso, using basic needs indoor water use and evaporative cooling use as determinants of household water consumption. Based on household size and income data from the US Census, fraction of household income spent on water was determined. Results reveal that in the future, basic water supply will be a significant burden for 40\% of all households in El Paso. Impacts are geographically concentrated in poor census tracts. Our study revealed that negative impacts from water resource depletion and increasing populations in El Paso will lead to costly and difficult water for El Paso water users. We provide an example of how to connect future resource scenarios, including those affected by climate change, to challenges of affordability for vulnerable consumers.}

  abstract = {Among all natural hazards inflicting the United States floods continue to impose the most economic disruption. Increasing physical risk coupled with development in flood-prone areas has amplified the adverse economic and human impacts of flooding. In an effort to counter mounting flood losses, the U.S. Federal Emergency Management Agency introduced the Community Rating System in 1990 as a way to incentivize local jurisdictions to exceed the existing minimum standard for floodplain management. In response to the lack of comprehensive knowledge on the effectiveness of the CRS, this study quantitatively evaluates the difference in flood losses experienced by CRS-participating communities. We pose the following research question: do CRS communities incur lower losses than non-CRS communities when accounting for contextual environmental and socioeconomic characteristics? Results from a two-step analysis consisting of propensity score matching and pooled linear regressions indicate that the CRS program has had a statistically significant effect on reducing the amount of insured flood losses incurred by communities across the U.S. In addition to receiving discounts on insurance premium rates, communities participating in the CRS also experienced a 41.6\% overall average reduction in flood claims compared to communities with similar characteristics that do not participate.}

By incorporating climate risk into asset prices, markets can discourage excessive development in hazardous areas. However, the extent to which markets actually price these risks remains poorly understood. Here we measure the effect of information about flood risk on residential property values in the United States. Using multiple empirical approaches and two decades of sales data covering the universe of homes in the US, we find little evidence that housing markets fully price information about flood risk in aggregate. However, the price penalty for flood risk is larger for commercial buyers and in states where sellers must disclose information about flood risk to potential buyers, suggesting that policies to improve risk communication could influence market outcomes. Our findings indicate that floodplain homes in the US are currently overvalued by a total of \$34B, raising concerns about the stability of real estate markets as climate risks become more salient and severe.Institutional subscribers to the NBER working paper series, and residents of developing countries may download this paper without additional charge at www.nber.org.}

We make progress towards this milestone by proposing a diffusion model for video generation that shows very promising initial results. Our model is a natural extension of the standard image diffusion architecture, and it enables jointly training from image and video data, which we find to reduce the variance of minibatch gradients and speed up optimization. To generate long and higher resolution videos we introduce a new conditional sampling technique for spatial and temporal video extension that performs better than previously proposed methods. We present the first results on a large text-conditioned video generation task, as well as state-of-the-art results on established benchmarks for video prediction and unconditional video generation.

  abstract = {Climate researchers use carbon dioxide emission scenarios to explore alternative climate futures and potential impacts, as well as implications of mitigation and adaptation policies. Often, these scenarios are published without formal probabilistic interpretations, given the deep uncertainty related to future development. However, users often seek such information, a likely range or relative probabilities. Without further specifications, users sometimes pick a small subset of emission scenarios and/or assume that all scenarios are equally likely. Here, we present probabilistic judgments of experts assessing the distribution of 2100 emissions under a business-as-usual and a policy scenario. We obtain the judgments through a method that relies only on pairwise comparisons of various ranges of emissions. There is wide variability between individual experts, but they clearly do not assign equal probabilities for the total range of future emissions. We contrast these judgments with the emission projection ranges derived from the shared socio-economic pathways (SSPs) and a recent multi-model comparison producing probabilistic emission scenarios. Differences on long-term emission probabilities between expert estimates and model-based calculations may result from various factors including model restrictions, a coverage of a wider set of factors by experts, but also group think and inability to appreciate long-term processes.}

  abstract = {Central Great Plains precipitation deficits during May\textendash August 2012 were the most severe since at least 1895, eclipsing the Dust Bowl summers of 1934 and 1936. Drought developed suddenly in May, following near-normal precipitation during winter and early spring. Its proximate causes were a reduction in atmospheric moisture transport into the Great Plains from the Gulf of Mexico. Processes that generally provide air mass lift and condensation were mostly absent, including a lack of frontal cyclones in late spring followed by suppressed deep convection in the summer owing to large-scale subsidence and atmospheric stabilization. Seasonal forecasts did not predict the summer 2012 central Great Plains drought development, which therefore arrived without early warning. Climate simulations and empirical analysis suggest that ocean surface temperatures together with changes in greenhouse gases did not induce a substantial reduction in sum mertime precipitation over the central Great Plains during 2012. Yet, diagnosis of the retrospective climate simulations also reveals a regime shift toward warmer and drier summertime Great Plains conditions during the recent decade, most probably due to natural decadal variability. As a consequence, the probability of the severe summer Great Plains drought occurring may have increased in the last decade compared to the 1980s and 1990s, and the so-called tail risk for severe drought may have been heightened in summer 2012. Such an extreme drought event was nonetheless still found to be a rare occurrence within the spread of 2012 climate model simulations. The implications of this study's findings for U.S. seasonal drought forecasting are discussed.}

  abstract = {Accurate representation of crop responses to climate is critically important to understand impacts of climate change and variability in food systems. We use Random Forest (RF), a diagnostic machine learning tool, to explore the dependence of yield on climate and technology for maize, sorghum and soybean in the US plains. We analyze the period from 1980 to 2016 and use a panel of county yields and climate variables for the crop-specific developmental phases: establishment, critical window (yield potential definition) and grain filling. The RF models accounted for between 71 to 86\% of the yield variance. Technology, evaluated through the variable time, accounted for approximately 20\% of the yield variance and indicates that yields have steadily increased. Responses to climate confirm prior findings revealing threshold-like responses to high temperature (yield decrease sharply when maximum temperature exceed 29 and 30\textdegree C for maize and soybean), and reveal a higher temperature tolerance for sorghum, whose yield decreases gradually as maximum temperature exceed 32.5\textdegree C. We also found that sorghum had low tolerance to low temperatures, and soybean responded positively to increasing minimum temperatures. Maize yield exhibited a unique strong response to atmospheric humidity (vapor pressure deficit) during the critical phase encompassing before to after flowering, as well as a strong sensitivity to extreme temperature exposure. Using maize as a benchmark, we estimate that if warming continues unabated, 50 years from now the best climatic conditions for rainfed maize and soybean production may shift from Iowa and Illinois to Minnesota and the Dakotas, a shift that will be modulated by soil productivity.}

  abstract = {Hamiltonian Monte Carlo (HMC) is a Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) algorithm that avoids the random walk behavior and sensitivity to correlated parameters that plague many MCMC methods by taking a series of steps informed by first-order gradient information. These features allow it to converge to high-dimensional target distributions much more quickly than simpler methods such as random walk Metropolis or Gibbs sampling. However, HMC's performance is highly sensitive to two user-specified parameters: a step size  and a desired number of steps L. In particular, if L is too small then the algorithm exhibits undesirable random walk behavior, while if L is too large the algorithm wastes computation. We introduce the No-U-Turn Sampler (NUTS), an extension to HMC that eliminates the need to set a number of steps L. NUTS uses a recursive algorithm to build a set of likely candidate points that spans a wide swath of the target distribution, stopping automatically when it starts to double back and retrace its steps. Empirically, NUTS perform at least as efficiently as and sometimes more efficiently than a well tuned standard HMC method, without requiring user intervention or costly tuning runs. We also derive a method for adapting the step size parameter  on the fly based on primal-dual averaging. NUTS can thus be used with no hand-tuning at all. NUTS is also suitable for applications such as BUGS-style automatic inference engines that require efficient "turnkey" sampling algorithms.},

Boxplots were designed to be drawn by hand and work best for small datasets, where detailed estimates of tail behavior beyond the quartiles may not be trustworthy. Larger datasets afford more precise estimates of tail behavior, but boxplots do not take advantage of this precision, instead presenting large numbers of extreme, though not unexpected, observations. Letter-value plots address this problem by including more detailed information about the tails using ``letter values,'' an order statistic defined by Tukey. Boxplots display the first two letter values (the median and quartiles); letter-value plots display further letter values so far as they are reliable estimates of their corresponding quantiles. We illustrate letter-value plots with real data that demonstrate their usefulness for large datasets. All graphics are created using the R package lvplot, and code and data are available in the supplementary materials.}

  abstract = {Extreme temperature events can have considerable negative impacts on sectors such as health, agriculture, and transportation. Observational evidence indicates the severity and frequency of warm extremes are increasing over much of the United States, but there are sizeable challenges both in estimating extreme temperature changes and in quantifying the relevant associated uncertainties. This study provides a simple statistical framework using a block maxima approach to analyze the representation of warm temperature extremes in several recent global climate model ensembles. Uncertainties due to structural model differences, grid resolution, and internal variability are characterized and discussed. Results show that models and ensembles differ greatly in the representation of extreme temperature over the United States, and variability in tail events is dependent on time and anthropogenic warming, which can influence estimates of return periods and distribution parameter estimates using generalized extreme value (GEV) distributions. These effects can considerably influence the uncertainty of model hindcasts and projections of extremes. Several idealized regional applications are highlighted for evaluating ensemble skill and trends, based on quantile analysis and root-mean-square errors in the overall sample and the upper tail. The results are relevant to regional climate assessments that use global model outputs and that are sensitive to extreme warm temperature. Accompanying this manuscript is a simple toolkit using the R statistical programming language for characterizing extreme events in gridded datasets.},

  abstract = {Model selection and model averaging have become popular tools to address conceptual uncertainty in hydro(geo)logical modeling. Within the last two decades, many different flavors of approaches and implementations have emerged which complicate an easy access to and a thorough understanding of the underlying principles. With the many approaches and applications, a variety of terms has been defined, which easily leads to misunderstandings and confusion among the community. Here, we review Bayesian model selection (BMS) and averaging (BMA) as a rigorous statistical framework for model choice under uncertainty. We aim to clarify the theoretical foundations of both methods, their relationship to one another and to alternative approaches, and implications of implementation choices. We further build a bridge to Bayesian model combination (BMC) which turns out to be Bayesian averaging or selection of combined models (BCMA/BCMS). Concluding from our theoretical review, we argue that the goal and the philosophical perspective of modeling should be main drivers when choosing to use the B(C)MS/A toolbox, and we offer guidance to identify the suitable approach for specific modeling goals. With this review, we hope to further strengthen the utility of Bayesian methods in the face of conceptual uncertainty by directing their use into the right channels.}

The Permanent Service for Mean Sea Level (PSMSL) continues to evolve and provide global coastal sea-level information and products that help to develop our understanding of sea-level and land motion processes. Its work aids a range of scientific research, not only in long-term change, but also in the measurement and understanding of higher frequency variability such as storm surges and tsunamis.

A generalized linear model (GLM) component allows exogenous variables to directly influence the distributional characteristics of precipitation at each site over time, while the Markovian transitions between discrete states represent seasonality and subseasonal weather variability. Model performance is evaluated for station networks of summer rainfall over the Punjab region in northern India and Pakistan and the upper Yangtze River basin in south-central China. The model captures seasonality and the marginal daily distributions well in both regions. Extremes are reproduced relatively well in the Punjab region, but underestimated for the Yangtze. In terms of interannual variability, the combined GLM\textendash HMM with spatiotemporal averages of observed rainfall as a predictor is shown to exhibit skill (in terms of reduced RMSE) at the station level, particularly for the Punjab region. The skill is largest for dry-day counts, moderate for seasonal rainfall totals, and very small for the number of extreme wet days.}

We present Random-Mask Video Diffusion (RaMViD), which extends image diffusion models to videos using 3D convolutions, and introduces a new conditioning technique during training. By varying the mask we condition on, the model is able to perform video prediction, infilling, and upsampling. Due to our simple conditioning scheme, we can utilize the same architecture as used for unconditional training, which allows us to train the model in a conditional and unconditional fashion at the same time. We evaluate the model on two benchmark datasets for video prediction, on which we achieve state-of-the-art results, and one for video generation.},

Probability-weighted moment estimators have low variance and no severe bias, and they compare favorably with estimators obtained by the methods of maximum likelihood or sextiles.

  abstract = {This study investigates a largely ignored contributor to wealth inequality in the United States: damages from natural hazards, which are expected to increase substantially in coming years. Instead of targeting a specific large-scale disaster and assessing how different subpopulations recover, we begin with a nationally representative sample of respondents from the restricted, geocoded Panel Study of Income Dynamics. We follow them through time (1999\textendash 2013) as hazard damages of varying scales accrue in the counties where they live. This design synthesizes the longitudinal, population-centered approach common in stratification research with a broad hazard-centered focus that extends beyond disasters to integrate ongoing environmental dynamics more centrally into the production of social inequality. Results indicate that as local hazard damages increase, so does wealth inequality, especially along lines of race, education, and homeownership. At any given level of local damage, the more aid an area receives from the Federal Emergency Management Agency, the more this inequality grows. These findings suggest that two defining social problems of our day \textendash{} wealth inequality and rising natural hazard damages \textendash{} are dynamically linked, requiring new lines of research and policy making in the future.}

Because weather variation plays a large role in recent progress, I formalize the relationship between climate and weather from an econometric perspective and discuss the use of these two factors as identifying variation, highlighting trade-offs between key assumptions in different research designs and deriving conditions when weather variation exactly identifies the effects of climate. I then describe recent advances, such as the parameterization of climate variables from a social perspective, use of nonlinear models with spatial and temporal displacement, characterization of uncertainty, measurement of adaptation, cross-study comparison, and use of empirical estimates to project the impact of future climate change.

However, the abundance of embedding literature has made it increasingly difficult to compare existing methods and to identify opportunities to advance the state-of-the-art. Meanwhile, existing work has left several fundamental questions -- such as how embeddings capture different structural scales and how they should be applied for effective link prediction -- unanswered. This paper addresses these challenges with an analytical framework for random-walk based graph embedding that consists of three components: a random-walk process, a similarity function, and an embedding algorithm. Our framework not only categorizes many existing approaches but naturally motivates new ones. With it, we illustrate novel ways to incorporate embeddings at multiple scales to improve downstream task performance. We also show that embeddings based on autocovariance similarity, when paired with dot product ranking for link prediction, outperform state-of-the-art methods based on Pointwise Mutual Information similarity by up to 100\%.},

It integrated river flow time series and Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) images to map inundation dynamics over the study area on both temporal and spatial dimensions. Flow data were analyzed to derive flow peaks and Annual Exceedance Probabilities (AEPs) using the annual flood series method. The peaks were linked with MODIS images for inundation detection. Ten annual maximum inundation maps were generated for water years 2001\textendash 2010, which were then overlaid to derive an inundation frequency map. AEPs were also combined with the annual maximum inundation maps to derive an inundation probability map. The resultant maps revealed spatial and temporal patterns of flood inundation in the basin, which will benefit ecological and environmental studies when considering response of floodplain and wetland ecosystems to flood inundation.}

The GCM runs forced with global and tropical Pacific SSTs produce similar multidecadal changes in precipitation, indicating the dominant influence of tropical Pacific SST. Companion experiments indicate that the shift in mean conditions in the tropical Pacific is responsible for these changes. The observed and simulated ``post- minus pre-1976'' difference in Jan\textendash May precipitation is wet over Mexico and the southwest U.S., dry over the Amazon, wet over sub-Amazonian South America, and dry over the southern tip of South America. This pattern is not dramatically different from a typical El Ni\~no-induced response in precipitation. Although the interdecadal (post- minus pre-1976) and interannual (El Ni\~no-La Ni\~na) SST anomalies differ in detail, they produce a common tropics-wide tropospheric warmth that may explain the similarity in the precipitation anomaly patterns for these two time scales. An analysis of local moisture budget shows that, except for Mexico and the southwest U.S. where the interdecadal shift in precipitation is balanced by evaporation, elsewhere over the Americas it is balanced by a shift in low-level moisture convergence. Moreover, the moisture convergence is due mainly to the change in low-level wind divergence that is linked to low-level ascent and descent.}

  abstract = {The uncertainty of a changing climate raises challenges for water infrastructure planning and design. Not accounting for nonstationarity may result in under-designed structures that fail too frequently, or over-designed structures that are economically inefficient. This concern is magnified by uncertainty in the long-term frequency and magnitude of future extreme events. Planning strategies that allow adaptations over a structure's life could improve both reliability and economic efficiency. This study develops a method to inform adaptive water infrastructure planning with uncertain hydrologic and other forms of nonstationarity, applied to levee system planning. A stochastic dynamic programming model including a Markov process is developed for infrastructure planning with uncertain nonstationarity in flood frequency. Bayes' theorem is used to update peak flow probabilities conditioned on observed past peak flows and to update expected residual flood damages over time. A levee system planning problem with a numerical example from California illustrates the approach to derive optimal levee heights over time, and economic values of adapting to uncertain nonstationary flood risk. The projected range of probabilistic hydrology scenarios affects the optimal results, particularly in later planning stages as hydrology scenarios diverge with time. Adaptive planning strategies allowing more levee upgrades over time slightly lowers the overall cost and provides better flood protection than one-time construction under nonstationary hydrology for any climate in the example. Compared to a known future nonstationary hydrology, incorporating uncertain nonstationary climate results in higher levees being planned for observed severe hydrology scenarios in later stages. The overall present value cost with uncertain nonstationary climate depends on rates of change in peak flow distribution parameters in future hydrology scenarios.}

  abstract = {Assessing potential damage of flood events is an important component in flood risk management. Determining direct flood damage is commonly done using depth-damage curves, which denote the flood damage that would occur at specific water depths per asset or per land-use class. Many countries have developed flood damage models using depth-damage curves based on analysis of past flood events and on expert judgement. However, the fact that such damage curves are not available for all regions hampers damage assessments in some areas. Moreover, due to different methodologies employed for various damage models in different countries, damage assessments cannot be directly compared with each other, obstructing also supra-national flood damage assessments. To address these problems a globally consistent database of depth-damage curves has been developed. This dataset contains damage curves depicting fractional damage as a function of water depth as well as the relevant maximum damage values for a variety of assets and land use classes. Based on an extensive literature survey normalised damage curves have been developed for each continent, while differentiation in flood damage between countries is established by determining maximum damage values at the country scale. These maximum damage values are based on construction cost surveys from multinational construction companies, which provide a coherent set of detailed building cost data across dozens of countries. A consistent set of maximum flood damage values for all countries was computed using statistical regressions with socio-economic World Development Indicators. Further, based on insights from the literature survey, guidance is also given on how the damage curves and maximum damage values can be adjusted for specific local circumstances, such as urban vs. rural locations or use of specific building material. This dataset can be used for consistent supra-national scale flood damage assessments, and guide assessment in countries where no damage model is currently available.},

  abstract = {Urban stormwater management is shifting its attention from traditional centralized engineering solutions to a distributed and greener approach, namely Green Infrastructure (GI). However, uncertainties concerning GI's efficacy for reducing runoff and pollutants are a barrier to the adoption of GI. One strategy to deal with the uncertainty is to implement GI adaptively, in which stormwater managers can learn and adjust their plans over time to avoid undesired outcomes. We propose a new class of GI planning methods based on two-stage stochastic programming and Bayesian learning, which accounts for projected information gains and decision makers' objectives and willingness to accept risk. In the hypothetical example, the model identifies four categories of investment strategies and quantifies their benefits and costs: all-in, greedy investment plus deferral, mixed investments plus deferral, and learn-and-adjust. Which strategy is optimal depends on the user's risk attitudes, and the alternatives' costs and risks.}

  abstract = {Summer weather extremes are often associated with high-amplitude atmospheric planetary waves (Petoukhov et al., 2013). Such conditions lead to stationary weather patterns, triggering heat waves and sometimes prolonged intense rainfall. These wave events, referred to as periods of Quasi-Resonant Amplification (QRA), are relatively rare though and hence provide only a few data points in the meteorological record to analyse. Here, we use atmospheric models coupled to boundary conditions that have evolved slowly (i.e., climate), to supplement measurements. Specifically we assess altered probabilities of resonant episodes by employing a unique massive ensemble of atmosphere-only climate simulations to populate statistical distributions of event occurrence. We focus on amplified waves during the two most extreme European heat waves on record, in years 2003 and 2015 (Russo et al., 2015). These years are compared with other modelled recent years (1987\textendash 2011), and critically against a modelled world without climate change. We find that there are differences in the statistical characteristics of wave event likelihood between years, suggesting a strong dependence on the known and prescribed Sea Surface Temperature (SST) patterns. The differences are larger than those projected to have occurred under climate change since the pre-industrial period. However, this feature of small differences since pre-industrial is based on single large ensembles, with members consisting of a range of estimates of SST adjustment from pre-industrial to present. Such SST changes are from projections by a set of coupled atmosphere\textendash ocean (AOGCM) climate models. When instead an ensemble for pre-industrial estimates is subdivided into simulations according to which AOGCM the SST changes are based on, we find differences in QRA occurrence. These differences suggest that to reliably estimate changes to extremes associated with altered amplification of planetary waves, and under future raised greenhouse gas concentrations, likely requires reductions in any spread of future modelled SST patterns.},

Changes in S/P ratio over time could influence the magnitude and timing of spring runoff and recession to summer baseflow. The S/P ratio for 21 U.S. Historical Climatology Network sites in New England was examined. Eleven out of twenty-one sites in New England had significant decreasing annual S/P ratios from 1949 to 2000. Annual trends in S/P are predominantly a result of decreasing snowfall, and to a lesser extent, increasing rainfall. The most consistent trends were in northernmost New England where all four sites had decreasing ratios, and in the coastal and near-coastal areas where five out of eight sites had significantly decreasing ratios. The four sites in northernmost New England, which had the strongest and most coherent trends, showed an average decrease in annual S/P ratio from about 0.30 in 1949 to 0.23 in 2000. Trends in winter S/P ratio were less geographically consistent. Seven out of 21 sites had significantly decreasing winter S/P ratios. Most northern New England and coastal to near-coastal sites had statistically significant trends (p {$<$} 0.05) or weak, but not significant trends (p {$<$} 0.2). When trends in S/P were analyzed on a monthly basis for the northernmost sites, it was evident that decreasing S/P trends were significant for March and December only. Significant correlations were observed between winter S/P ratios in northern New England and the timing of spring runoff, the North Atlantic Oscillation (NAO) index, and the Pacific\textendash North American (PNA) index. Significant correlations were observed between winter S/P ratios averaged for all of New England and the NAO and PNA.}

  abstract = {For many environmental processes, recent studies have shown that the dependence strength is decreasing when quantile levels increase. This implies that the popular max-stable models are inadequate to capture the rate of joint tail decay, and to estimate joint extremal probabilities beyond observed levels. We here develop a more flexible modeling framework based on the class of max-infinitely divisible processes, which extend max-stable processes while retaining dependence properties that are natural for maxima. We propose two parametric constructions for max-infinitely divisible models, which relax the max-stability property but remain close to some popular max-stable models obtained as special cases. The first model considers maxima over a finite, random number of independent observations, while the second model generalizes the spectral representation of max-stable processes. Inference is performed using a pairwise likelihood. We illustrate the benefits of our new modeling framework on Dutch wind gust maxima calculated over different time units. Results strongly suggest that our proposed models outperform other natural models, such as the Student-t copula process and its max-stable limit, even for large block sizes.}

The approach is demonstrated using the London water supply system. Promising portfolios of interventions (e.g., new supplies, water conservation schemes, etc.) that meet London's estimated water supply demands in 2035 are shown to face significant trade-offs between financial, engineering and environmental measures of performance. Robust portfolios are identified by contrasting the multi-objective results attained for (1) historically observed baseline conditions versus (2) future global change scenarios. An ensemble of global change scenarios is computed using climate change impacted hydrological flows, plausible water demands, environmentally motivated abstraction reductions, and future energy prices. The proposed multi-scenario trade-off analysis screens for robust investments that provide benefits over a wide range of futures, including those with little change. Our results suggest that 60 percent of intervention portfolios identified as Pareto optimal under historical conditions would fail under future scenarios considered relevant by stakeholders. Those that are able to maintain good performance under historical conditions can no longer be considered to perform optimally under future scenarios. The individual investment options differ significantly in their ability to cope with varying conditions. Visualizing the individual infrastructure and demand management interventions implemented in the Pareto optimal portfolios in multi-dimensional space aids the exploration of how the interventions affect the robustness and performance of the system.}

  abstract = {General circulation models (GCMs), used to predict rainfall at a seasonal lead-time, tend to simulate too many rainfall events of too low intensity relative to individual stations within a GCM grid cell. Even if bias in total rainfall is corrected relative to a target location, this distortion of frequency and intensity is expected to adversely affect simulations of crop growth and yield. We present a procedure that calibrates both the frequency and the intensity distribution of daily GCM rainfall relative to a target station, and demonstrate its application to maize yield simulation at a location in semi-arid Kenya. If GCM rainfall frequency is greater than observed frequency for a given month, averaged across years, GCM rainfall frequency is corrected by discarding rainfall events below a calibrated threshold. To correct the intensity distribution, each GCM rainfall amount above the calibrated threshold is mapped from the GCM intensity distribution onto the observed distribution. We used a gamma distribution for observed rainfall intensity, and considered both gamma and empirical distributions for GCM rainfall intensity. At the study location, the proposed correction procedure corrected both the mean and variance of monthly and seasonal GCM rainfall total, frequency and mean intensity. The empirical (GCM)-gamma (observed) transformation overestimated mean intensity slightly. A simple multiplicative shift did a better job of correcting monthly and seasonal rainfall totals, but left substantial frequency and intensity bias. All of the bias correction procedures improved maize yield simulations, but resulted in substantial negative mean bias. This bias appears to be associated with a tendency for the GCM rainfall to be more strongly autocorrelated than observed rainfall, resulting in unrealistically long dry spells during the growing season. Nonlinearity of crop response to the variability of water availability across GCM realizations may also contribute. Averaging simulated yields each year across multiple GCM realizations improved yield predictions. The proposed correction procedure provides an option for using the daily output of dynamic climate prediction models for impact studies in a manner that preserves any useful predictive information about the timing of rainfall within the season. However, its practical utility for yield forecasting at a long lead-time may be limited by the ability of GCMs to simulate rainfall with a realistic time structure.}

  abstract = {Global climate models (GCMs) are promising for crop yield predictions because of their ability to simulate seasonal climate in advance of the growing season. However, their utility is limited by unrealistic time structure of daily rainfall and biases in rainfall frequency and intensity distributions. Crop growth is very sensitive to daily variations of rainfall; thus any mismatch in daily rainfall statistics could impact crop yield simulations. Here, we present an improved methodology to correct GCM rainfall biases and time structure mismatches for maize yield prediction in Katumani, Kenya. This includes GCM bias correction (BC), to correct over- or under-predictions of rainfall frequency and intensity, and nesting corrected GCM information with a stochastic weather generator, to generate daily rainfall realizations conditioned on a given monthly target. Bias-corrected daily GCM rainfall and generated rainfall realizations were used to evaluate crop response. Results showed that corrections of GCM rainfall frequency and intensity could improve crop yield prediction but yields remain under-predicted. This is strongly attributed to the time structure mismatch in daily GCM rainfall leading to excessively long dry spells. To address this, we tested several ways of improving daily structure of GCM rainfall. First, we tested calibrating thresholds in BC but were found not very effective for improving dry spell lengths. Second, we tested BC-stochastic disaggregation (BC-DisAg) and appeared to simulate more realistic dry spell lengths using bias-corrected GCM rainfall information (e.g., frequency, totals) as monthly targets. Using rainfall frequency alone to condition the weather generator removed biases in dry spell lengths, improved predicted yields, but under-predicted yield variability. Combining rainfall frequency and totals, however, not only produced more realistic yield variability but also corrected under-prediction of yields. We envisaged that the presented method would enhance the utility of daily GCM rainfall in crop yield prediction. Copyright \textcopyright{} 2010 Royal Meteorological Society},

  abstract = {Based on monthly mean sea level pressure grids objectively reconstructed by Luterbacher et al. variations of dynamical modes of the atmospheric circulation for January and July are described by novel indices for running 31-year periods between 1659 and 1999. These indices reflect the continuous evolution of the atmospheric circulation not only with regard to frequency changes of major dynamical modes but also in terms of internal changes within each mode concerning both dynamic (vorticity, intensity) and climatic properties (Central European temperature and precipitation during occurrence of each mode, respectively). Results indicate the great importance of within-mode variations: the zonal circulation mode in January, varying in frequency with long-term cycles, primarily changed its dynamic and climatic properties (towards higher indices) during the transition from the Little Ice Age to modern conditions between 1800 and 1930. Within the Russian High mode of January a change in preference from easterly to westerly patterns above Central Europe occurred around 1850. For July, a striking frequency maximum of the westerly mode at the end of the eighteenth century coincided with a period of marked summer warmth in Central Europe due to negative/positive deviations in vorticity/temperature during occurrence of this mode. The long-term evolution in July indicates a general increase of anticyclonic conditions strengthening during the last 50 years towards a unique phenomenon within the last centuries. The strong increase in the winter-time westerly circulation during the last decades, however, does not appear extraordinary in view of the low-frequency variations of this mode.}

Considering the high uncertainties involved in the modeling of a nonlinear and complex flood event, providing a deterministic flood inundation map can be erroneous and misleading for reliable and timely decision-making. The conventional flood hazard maps provided for different return periods cannot also represent the actual dynamics of flooding rivers. Therefore, a real-time modeling framework that forecasts the inundation areas before the onset of an upcoming flood is of paramount importance. Sequential data assimilation (DA) techniques are well known for real-time operation of physical models while accounting for existing uncertainties. In this study, we present a DA hydrodynamic modeling framework where multiple gauge observations are integrated into the LISFLOOD-FP model to improve its performance. This study utilizes the ensemble Kalman filter (EnKF) in a multivariate fashion for dual estimation of model state variables and parameters where the correlations among point source observations are taken into account. First, a synthetic experiment is designed to assess the performance of the proposed approach; then the method is used to simulate the Hurricane Harvey flood in 2017. Our results indicate that the multivariate assimilation of point source observations into hydrodynamic models can improve the accuracy and reliability of probabilistic flood inundation mapping by 5 \%\textendash 7 \%, while it also provides the basis for sequential updating and real-time flood inundation mapping.{$<$}/p{$>$}}

  abstract = {Models for supporting climate adaptation and mitigation planning, mostly in the form of Integrated Assessment Models, are poorly equipped for aiding questions related to fairness of adaptation and mitigation strategies, because they often disregard distributional outcomes. When evaluating policies using such models, the costs and benefits are typically aggregated across all actors in the system, and over the entire planning horizon. While a policy may be beneficial when considering the aggregate outcome, it can be harmful to some people, somewhere, at some point in time. The practice of aggregating over all actors and over time thus gives rise to problems of justice; it could also exacerbate existing injustices. While the literature discusses some of these injustices in ad-hoc and case specific manner, a systematic approach for considering distributive justice in model-based climate change planning is lacking. This study aims to fill this gap by proposing 11 requirements that an Integrated Assessment Model should meet in order to enable the assessment of distributive justice in climate mitigation and adaptation policies. We derive the requirements from various ethical imperatives stemming from the theory of distributive justice. More specifically, we consider both intra-generational (among people within one generation) and intergenerational (between generations) distributive justice. We investigate to what extent the 11 requirements are being met in recent model-based climate planning studies, and highlight several directions for future research to advance the accounting for distributive justice in model-based support for climate change planning.

These extreme heat conditions, which typically affect northern, central, and western parts of India and Pakistan, have also extended to southern parts of India, where people and governments are not as well prepared.1 Ambient temperatures reached above 47C in India by the end of April and 49.5C in Pakistan in early May with land surface temperatures reaching an unprecedented 62C on 4 May in central India.2 We are still only in the middle of the hot season and await further high temperatures with dread, especially the peak heat period of Nau-tappa (nine-days of heat) usually around 25 May to 3 June. Although maximum temperatures are likely to decline in June and July, the heat may be more dangerous as humidity will increase \ldots},

  abstract = {Two-dimensional hydrodynamic models numerically solve full Shallow Water Equations (SWEs). Despite their high accuracy, these models have long simulation run times and therefore are of limited use for exploratory or real-time flood predictions. We investigated the possibility of improving flood modelling speed using Machine Learning (ML). We propose a new method that replaces the computationally expensive parts of the hydrodynamic models with simple and efficient data-driven approximations. Our hypothesis is that by integrating ML with physics-based numerical methods, we can achieve improved generalization performance: that is, the trained model for one case study can be used in other studies without the need for new training. We tested two ML approaches: for the first, we integrated curve fitting, and, for the second, artificial neural networks (ANN) with a finite volume scheme to solve the local inertial approximation of the SWEs. The data-driven models approximated the Momentum Equation, which explicitly solved the time derivative of flow rates. Water depths were then updated by applying a water balance equation. We also tested two different training datasets: the simulated dataset, generated from the results of hydrodynamic model, and the random dataset, generated by directly solving the momentum equation on randomly sampled input data. Various combinations of input features, for example, water slope and depth, were explored. The proposed models were trained in a small hypothetical case and tested in a different hypothetical and in two real case studies. Results showed that the curve-fitting method can be implemented successfully, given sufficient training and input data. The ANN model trained with a random dataset was substantially more accurate than that of the model trained with the simulated dataset. However, it was not successful in the real case studies. The curve-fitting method resulted in better generalization performance and increased the simulation speed of the local inertial model by 23\%. Future research should test the performance of ML in terms of an increase in stable time step size and approximation of the full SWEs.}

  abstract = {It is well known that rainwater harvesting (RWH) can augment water supply and reduce stormwater pollutant discharges. Due to the lack of continuous 2D modelling of urban flood coverage and its associated damage, the ability of RWH to reduce urban flood risks has not been fully evaluated. Literature suggests that small distributed storage spaces using RWH tanks will reduce flood damage only during small to medium flooding events and therefore cumulative assessment of their benefits is needed. In this study we developed a new integrated modelling framework that implements a semi-continuous simulation approach to investigate flood prevention and water supply benefits of RWH tanks. The framework includes a continuous mass balance simulation model that considers antecedent rainfall conditions and water demand/usage of tanks and predicts the available storage prior to each storm event. To do so, this model couples a rainfall-runoff tank storage model with a detailed stochastic end-use water demand model. The available storage capacity of tanks is then used as a boundary condition for the novel rapid flood simulation model. This flood model was developed by coupling the U.S. EPA Storm Water Management Model (SWMM) to the Cellular-Automata Fast Flood Evaluation (CA-ff\'e) model to predict the inundation depth caused by surcharges over the capacity of the drainage network. The stage-depth damage curves method was used to calculate time series of flood damage, which are then directly used for flood risk and cost-benefit analysis. The model was tested through a case study in Melbourne, using a recorded rainfall time series of 85 years (after validating the flood model against 1D-2D MIKE-FLOOD). Results showed that extensive implementation of RWH tanks in the study area is economically feasible and can reduce expected annual damage in the catchment by up to approximately 30 percent. Availability of storage space and temporal distribution of rainfall within an event were important factors affecting tank performance for flood reduction.}

  abstract = {Many contemporary organizations depend on team-based organizing to achieve high performance, innovate services and products, and adapt to environmental turbulence. Significant research focuses on understanding how teams develop, assimilate, and apply diverse information; yet, organizational practices have evolved in new ways that are not fully explored in the teams literature. Individuals with diverse motivations, knowledge, and perspectives are often assigned to teams, creating burdens for members to develop effective ways to work together, learn from each other, and achieve goals amid the complexity of today's organizational contexts. In this paper, we examine a multilevel model of how team goal orientation affects cross-understanding\textemdash the extent to which team members understand the other members' mental models\textemdash which in turn, affects team and individual performance. We examine these effects using 160 teams of 859 participants who completed a semester-long business simulation. Findings show that the more team members are motivated by learning goals, the greater a team's cross-understanding and subsequent team and individual performance. These effects are dampened when members are motivated by performance goals\textemdash to avoid mistakes or prove competence. This study expands the cross-understanding literature, revealing motivational antecedents that explain why some teams develop higher cross-understanding than others. We also contribute to the goal orientation literature by demonstrating that team goal orientation influences members' learning about other members and in so doing, also affects team and individual performance. Because team motivation can be influenced by organizational practices, our findings also contribute practical insights for organizational leaders.}

Here we use observational data and an ensemble of climate change model experiments (from the Coupled Model Intercomparison Project Phase 5 (CMIP5)) to examine past and potential future seasonal changes in extreme precipitation event frequency over the United States. Using the extreme precipitation index as a metric for extreme precipitation change, we find key differences between models and observations. In particular, the CMIP5 models tend to overestimate the number of spring events and underestimate the number of summer events. This seasonal shift in the models is amplified in projections. These results provide a basis for evaluating climate model skill in simulating observed seasonality and changes in regional extreme precipitation. Additionally, we highlight key sources of variability and uncertainty that can potentially inform regional impact analyses and adaptation planning.}

  abstract = {Tightly constraint parameter ranges are seen as an important goal in constructing hydrological models, a difficult task in complex models. However, many studies show that complex models are often good at capturing the behaviour of a river. Therefore, this study explores the trade-offs between tightly constrained parameters and the ability to predict hydrological signatures, that capture the behaviour of a river. To accomplish this we built five models of differing complexity, ranging from a simple lumped model to a semi-lumped model with eight spatial subdivisions. All models are built within the same modelling framework, use the same data, and are calibrated with the same algorithm. We also consider two different methods for the potential evapotranspiration. We found that that there is a clear trade-off along the axis of complexity. While the more simple models can constrain their parameters quite well, they fail to get the hydrological signatures right. It is the other way around for the more complex models. The method of evapotranspiration only influences the parameters directly related to it. This study highlights that it is important to focus not only on parametric uncertainty. Tightly constrained parameters can be misguiding as they give credibility to oversimplified model structures.},

The complexity of a ``no-win'' waterscape \textendash{} where water service exists but is relatively expensive and water quality is still precarious \textendash{} precludes a meaningful assessment and analysis because there are no existing measurement tools to capture water insecurity at the household level. Informed by critical environmental epistemology, the paper incorporates perspectives from colonias residents through qualitative research and survey development. The study advances previous work on water security by developing a cumulative scale for each characteristic of household water security then clusters households into water security classes using a non-parametric statistical procedure. The analysis identified four water security classes: (1) Water Secure; (2) Marginally Water Secure; (3) Marginally Water Insecure; (4) Water Insecure. While all households in the survey are connected to water service, only 45\% are broadly ``water secure'' while 55\% are ``water insecure.'' Statistical analysis confirmed the robustness of the scaling and clustering procedure, thus, providing evidence to describe household water insecurity in ``no-win'' waterscapes.}

  abstract = {The North Atlantic Oscillation (NAO), the East Atlantic (EA) and the Scandinavian (SCAND) modes are the three main large-scale circulation patterns driving the climate variability of the Iberian Peninsula. This study assesses their influence in terms of solar (photovoltaic) and wind power generation potential (SP and WP) and evaluates their skill as predictors. For that we use a hindcast regional climate simulation to retrieve the primary meteorological variables involved, surface solar radiation and wind speed. First we identify that the maximum influence of the various modes occurs on the interannual variations of the monthly mean SP and WP series, being generally more relevant in winter. Second we find that in this time-scale and season, SP (WP) varies up to 30\% (40\%) with respect to the mean climatology between years with opposite phases of the modes, although the strength and the spatial distribution of the signals differ from one month to another. Last, the skill of a multi-linear regression model (MLRM), built using the NAO, EA and SCAND indices, to reconstruct the original wintertime monthly series of SP and WP was investigated. The reconstructed series (when the MLRM is calibrated for each month individually) correlate with the original ones up to 0.8 at the interannual time-scale. Besides, when the modeled series for each individual month are merged to construct an October-to-March monthly series, and after removing the annual cycle in order to account for monthly anomalies, these correlate 0.65 (0.55) with the original SP (WP) series in average. These values remain fairly stable when the calibration and reconstruction periods differ, thus supporting up to a point the predictive potential of the method at the time-scale assessed here.}

Estimating surge-based flood risk with the coastal Louisiana risk assessment model.The Coastal Louisiana Risk Assessment model (CLARA) was designed to facilitate comparisons of current and future flood risk under a variety of protection system configurations in a wide range of environmental, operational, and economic uncertainties. It builds on previous studies of coastal risk by incorporating system fragility and a larger number of future scenarios than previously analyzed. Flood depths and direct economic damage from a wide range of simulated storm events are aggregated to produce a statistical summary of coastal risk under different assumptions about future conditions. CLARA's estimates of project-level effects on flood risk reduction were used as one of the key decision drivers in selecting the risk reduction projects included in the Master Plan. Depending on the scenario, the final alternative is projected to reduce expected annual damage by approximately 60 to 80\% during the next 50 years relative to a future without action and, at the same time, balance other decision criteria.}

A growing body of evidence suggests that a more diverse professional US workforce that better reflects the nation's demographics can be achieved through numerous strategies aimed at effectively recruiting, supporting through graduation, and facilitating the increased participation of underrepresented minorities in Earth, atmospheric, and ocean sciences (and other related) graduate degree programs. To provide background and context for understanding the diversity challenge, we first describe expectations for the future US population and compare these projections to information about today's demographic realities and the situation for the geosciences (including the ocean sciences) in particular. Descriptions of several specific implementations provide examples of successful strategies and reflect the research-based positive factors shown to foster increased engagement of underrepresented minorities.}

The SALLJ transports large amounts of moisture to greatly influence the variability in rainfall in south-east South America. Using records spanning more than 100 years, Charles Jones and Leila Carvalho at the University of California, Santa Barbara, USA, identified a consistent correlation linking the levels of precipitation under the influence of SALLJ and the phase of the AMO. This cyclical influence, which repeats with a periodicity of 60-80 years, seems driven by the AMO affecting atmospheric circulation in the equatorial Atlantic. The results may help predict the influence of natural climate variability in South America.},

  abstract = {The global impacts of river floods are substantial and rising. Effective adaptation to the increasing risks requires an in-depth understanding of the physical and socioeconomic drivers of risk. Whereas the modeling of flood hazard and exposure has improved greatly, compelling evidence on spatiotemporal patterns in vulnerability of societies around the world is still lacking. Due to this knowledge gap, the effects of vulnerability on global flood risk are not fully understood, and future projections of fatalities and losses available today are based on simplistic assumptions or do not include vulnerability. We show for the first time (to our knowledge) that trends and fluctuations in vulnerability to river floods around the world can be estimated by dynamic high-resolution modeling of flood hazard and exposure. We find that rising per-capita income coincided with a global decline in vulnerability between 1980 and 2010, which is reflected in decreasing mortality and losses as a share of the people and gross domestic product exposed to inundation. The results also demonstrate that vulnerability levels in low- and high-income countries have been converging, due to a relatively strong trend of vulnerability reduction in developing countries. Finally, we present projections of flood losses and fatalities under 100 individual scenario and model combinations, and three possible global vulnerability scenarios. The projections emphasize that materialized flood risk largely results from human behavior and that future risk increases can be largely contained using effective disaster risk reduction strategies.}

To study the effects of structural intervention and urban development on the evolution of the floodplain, we have chosen two neighboring urban watersheds in Houston, TX: Brays Bayou and Buffalo Bayou. While the two watersheds are similar in size, topography, and development level, they have contrasting riverine flood management approaches. Brays Bayou is channelized, whereas Buffalo Bayou remains mostly unchannelized. We use the distributed hydrologic model, Vflo\textregistered, and the hydraulic model, HEC-RAS, to analyze channel hydraulics and floodplain extent in the two watersheds under the 10- and 100-year rainfall scenarios at three points in time: 1970s (early development), 2011 (current development), and 2040 (future development). We find that, while floodplain extent in both watersheds increases over time, the relative change in floodplain extent for Brays Bayou (channelized) is substantially larger than that for Buffalo Bayou (unchannelized). The results in this study contribute to a better understanding of the long-term performance of two flood mitigation approaches (channelization and setbacks) on riverine flood risk and provide insight into best management practices for cities experiencing rapid urban growth.},

  abstract = {This paper evaluates watershed-scale hydrologic performance of low-impact development (LID) features at two catchments in the Houston, Texas, region. White Oak Bayou is a traditional urban watershed that is frequently plagued with flooding. In contrast, The Woodlands is a master-planned suburban community designed to preserve its natural hydrology by implementing large-scale conservation features. The objectives of this study are threefold: (1) to propose a method to simulate small-scale infiltration-based LID features over a large area by using a distributed hydrologic model; (2) to quantify the cumulative hydrologic responses of watershedwide LID implementation; and (3) to compare the flood reduction potential between two distinct LID strategies (conservation LID and retrofit LID). Conservation (masterplanned) LID integrates large-scale features (e.g., riparian buffers and swales) early in a watershed's development, whereas retrofit LID implements site-scale features (e.g., green roofs and rain gardens) after the watershed has been fully developed. The results of this study demonstrate varying degrees of flood reduction (i.e., peak discharge and runoff volume) at the watershed outlets with respect to different LID features and rainfall events. The results also showed that although retrofitted watersheds could not quite match the hydrologic performances of master-planned watersheds, they could still enjoy the benefit of flood reduction during smaller storms.

It provides comprehensive information on the studies' specifications and globally summarizes the reported wind resource changes. The studies show substantial differences in design, limiting their comparability. Most studies evaluated a small number of regional climate models driven by general circulation models from CMIP5 under the worst-case scenario RCP8.5. The use of worst-case scenarios can be justified, intending to study climate change impacts for the most significant climate change signal. To quantify the differences between present and future resources, very short evaluation periods with average durations of 23.8 and 24.9 years were used. Our analysis reveals that the availability and distribution of wind resources would likely change in the future. The changes' magnitudes are usually greatest under the most pessimistic climate change scenarios. The direction of the changes varies spatially. The strongest wind resource decline was observed in the Western United States. Declining wind resources are likely in most parts of the northern hemisphere. For southern Brazil, a distinct wind resource increase is projected. For the design of future studies, it is recommended to use (1) the more realistic climate change scenarios SSP245, SSP460, and SSP370, (2) multi-model ensembles, which allow testing the statistical significance of the detected changes, (3) longer investigation periods ({$\geq$}30 years) to reinforce the climate change relevance of the statements made.}

Moreover, water main leaks affect other neighboring infrastructure that may lead to catastrophic failures. For this, municipality authorities or stakeholders are more concerned about preventive actions rather reacting to failure events. This paper presents a Bayesian Belief Network (BBN) model to evaluate the risk of failure of metallic water mains using structural integrity, hydraulic capacity, water quality, and consequence factors. BBN is a probabilistic graphical model that represents a set of variables and their probabilistic relationships, which also captures historical information about these dependencies. The proposed model is capable of ranking water mains within distribution network that can identify vulnerable and sensitive pipes to justify proper decision action for maintenance/rehabilitation/replacement (M/R/R). To demonstrate the application of proposed model, water distribution network of City of Kelowna has been studied. Result indicates that almost 9\% of the total 259 metallic pipes are at high risk in both summer and winter.}

  abstract = {This paper presents a critique of expected utility theory as a descriptive model of decision making under risk, and develops an alternative model, called prospect theory. Choices among risky prospects exhibit several pervasive effects that are inconsistent with the basic tenets of utility theory. In particular, people underweight outcomes that are merely probable in comparison with outcomes that are obtained with certainty. This tendency, called the certainty effect, contributes to risk aversion in choices involving sure gains and to risk seeking in choices involving sure losses. In addition, people generally discard components that are shared by all prospects under consideration. This tendency, called the isolation effect, leads to inconsistent preferences when the same choice is presented in different forms. An alternative theory of choice is developed, in which value is assigned to gains and losses rather than to final assets and in which probabilities are replaced by decision weights. The value function is normally concave for gains, commonly convex for losses, and is generally steeper for losses than for gains. Decision weights are generally lower than the corresponding probabilities, except in the range of low probabilities. Overweighting of low probabilities may contribute to the attractiveness of both insurance and gambling.}

This study helped SEDAPAL, the water utility serving Lima, Peru, answer this question by drawing on state of the art methods for decision making under deep uncertainty. These methods provide techniques for evaluating the performance of a water system over a wide range of plausible futures and then developing strategies that are robust across these futures. Rather than weighting futures probabilistically to define an optimal strategy, these methodologies identify the vulnerabilities of a system and then evaluate the key trade-offs among different adaptive strategies. Through extensive iteration and collaboration with SEDAPAL, the study used these methods to define an investment strategy that is robust, ensuring water reliability across as wide a range of future conditions as possible while also being economically efficient. First,on completion, the study helped SEDAPAL realize that not all projects included in the Master Plan were necessary to achieve water reliability, and the utility could save 25 percent (more than \$600 million) in investment costs. Second, the study helped focus future efforts on demand-side management, pricing, and soft infrastructure, a refocusing that is difficult to achieve in traditional utility companies. Third, the study helped SEDAPAL gain the support of regulatory and budget agencies through the careful analysis of alternatives. Fourth, the study allowed the utility to postpone lower priority investments, and to analyze future options based on climate and demand information that simply is not available now.}

  abstract = {Important surface observations such as the daily maximum and minimum temperature, daily precipitation, and cloud ceilings often have localized characteristics that are difficult to reproduce with the current resolution and the physical parameterizations in state-of-the-art General Circulation climate Models (GCMs). Many of the difficulties can be partially attributed to mismatches in scale, local topography. regional geography and boundary conditions between models and surface-based observations. Here, we present a method, called climatological projection by model statistics (CPMS), to relate GCM grid-point flee-atmosphere statistics, the predictors, to these important local surface observations. The method can be viewed as a generalization of the model output statistics (MOS) and perfect prog (PP) procedures used in numerical weather prediction (NWP) models. It consists of the application of three statistical methods: 1) principle component analysis (FICA), 2) canonical correlation, and 3) inflated regression analysis. The PCA reduces the redundancy of the predictors The canonical correlation is used to develop simultaneous relationships between linear combinations of the predictors, the canonical variables, and the surface-based observations. Finally, inflated regression is used to relate the important canonical variables to each of the surface-based observed variables. We demonstrate that even an early version of the Oregon State University two-level atmospheric GCM (with prescribed sea surface temperature) produces free-atmosphere statistics than can, when standardized using the model's internal means and variances (the MOS-like version of CPMS), closely approximate the observed local climate. When the model data are standardized by the observed free-atmosphere means and variances (the PP version of CPMS), however, the model does not reproduce the observed surface climate as well. Our results indicate that in the MOS-like version of CPMS the differences between the output of a ten-year GCM control run and the surface-based observations are often smaller than the differences between the observations of two ten-year periods. Such positive results suggest that GCMs may already contain important climatological information that can be used to infer the local climate.}

  abstract = {Geosciences is a field of great societal relevance that requires solutions to several urgent problems facing our humanity and the planet. As geosciences enters the era of big data, machine learning (ML) -- that has been widely successful in commercial domains -- offers immense potential to contribute to problems in geosciences. However, problems in geosciences have several unique challenges that are seldom found in traditional applications, requiring novel problem formulations and methodologies in machine learning. This article introduces researchers in the machine learning (ML) community to these challenges offered by geoscience problems and the opportunities that exist for advancing both machine learning and geosciences. We first highlight typical sources of geoscience data and describe their properties that make it challenging to use traditional machine learning techniques. We then describe some of the common categories of geoscience problems where machine learning can play a role, and discuss some of the existing efforts and promising directions for methodological development in machine learning. We conclude by discussing some of the emerging research themes in machine learning that are applicable across all problems in the geosciences, and the importance of a deep collaboration between machine learning and geosciences for synergistic advancements in both disciplines.},

The framework couples global sensitivity analysis using Sobol' variance decomposition with multiobjective evolutionary algorithms (MOEAs) to generate planning alternatives and test their robustness to new modeling assumptions and scenarios. We explore these issues within the context of a risk-based water supply management problem, where a city seeks the most efficient use of a water market. The case study examines a single city's water supply in the Lower Rio Grande Valley (LRGV) in Texas, using a suite of 6-objective problem formulations that have increasing decision complexity for both a 10-year planning horizon and an extreme single-year drought scenario. The de Novo planning framework demonstrated illustrates how to adaptively improve the value and robustness of our problem formulations by evolving our definition of optimality while discovering key tradeoffs.}

MORDM combines concepts and methods from many objective evolutionary optimization and robust decision making (RDM), along with extensive use of interactive visual analytics, to facilitate the management of complex environmental systems. Many objective evolutionary search is used to generate alternatives for complex planning problems, enabling the discovery of the key tradeoffs among planning objectives. RDM then determines the robustness of planning alternatives to deeply uncertain future conditions and facilitates decision makers' selection of promising candidate solutions. MORDM tests each solution under the ensemble of future extreme states of the world (SOW). Interactive visual analytics are used to explore whether solutions of interest are robust to a wide range of plausible future conditions (i.e., assessment of their Pareto satisficing behavior in alternative SOW). Scenario discovery methods that use statistical data mining algorithms are then used to identify what assumptions and system conditions strongly influence the cost-effectiveness, efficiency, and reliability of the robust alternatives. The framework is demonstrated using a case study that examines a single city's water supply in the Lower Rio Grande Valley (LRGV) in Texas, USA. Results suggest that including robustness as a decision criterion can dramatically change the formulation of complex environmental management problems as well as the negotiated selection of candidate alternatives to implement. MORDM also allows decision makers to characterize the most important vulnerabilities for their systems, which should be the focus of ex post monitoring and identification of triggers for adaptive management.}

  abstract = {In a 1935 paper and in his book Theory of Probability, Jeffreys developed a methodology for quantifying the evidence in favor of a scientific theory. The centerpiece was a number, now called the Bayes factor, which is the posterior odds of the null hypothesis when the prior probability on the null is one-half. Although there has been much discussion of Bayesian hypothesis testing in the context of criticism of P-values, less attention has been given to the Bayes factor as a practical tool of applied statistics. In this article we review and discuss the uses of Bayes factors in the context of five scientific applications in genetics, sports, ecology, sociology, and psychology. We emphasize the following points: \textbullet{} From Jeffreys' Bayesian viewpoint, the purpose of hypothesis testing is to evaluate the evidence in favor of a scientific theory. \textbullet{} Bayes factors offer a way of evaluating evidence in favor of a null hypothesis. \textbullet{} Bayes factors provide a way of incorporating external information into the evaluation of evidence about a hypothesis. \textbullet{} Bayes factors are very general and do not require alternative models to be nested. \textbullet{} Several techniques are available for computing Bayes factors, including asymptotic approximations that are easy to compute using the output from standard packages that maximize likelihoods. \textbullet{} In ``nonstandard'' statistical models that do not satisfy common regularity conditions, it can be technically simpler to calculate Bayes factors than to derive non-Bayesian significance tests. \textbullet{} The Schwarz criterion (or BIC) gives a rough approximation to the logarithm of the Bayes factor, which is easy to use and does not require evaluation of prior distributions. \textbullet{} When one is interested in estimation or prediction, Bayes factors may be converted to weights to be attached to various models so that a composite estimate or prediction may be obtained that takes account of structural or model uncertainty. \textbullet{} Algorithms have been proposed that allow model uncertainty to be taken into account when the class of models initially considered is very large. \textbullet{} Bayes factors are useful for guiding an evolutionary model-building process. \textbullet{} It is important, and feasible, to assess the sensitivity of conclusions to the prior distributions used.}

  abstract = {Subjectivism has become the dominant philosophical foundation for Bayesian inference. Yet in practice, most Bayesian analyses are performed with so-called "noninformative" priors, that is, priors constructed by some formal rule. We review the plethora of techniques for constructing such priors and discuss some of the practical and philosophical issues that arise when they are used. We give special emphasis to Jeffreys's rules and discuss the evolution of his viewpoint about the interpretation of priors, away from unique representation of ignorance toward the notion that they should be chosen by convention. We conclude that the problems raised by the research on priors chosen by formal rules are serious and may not be dismissed lightly: When sample sizes are small (relative to the number of parameters being estimated), it is dangerous to put faith in any "default" solution; but when asymptotics take over, Jeffreys's rules and their variants remain reasonable choices. We also provide an annotated bibliography.}

Firstly, the model is validated against historic observations at 10 m, before being applied to the Representative Concentration Pathways (RCPs) 4.5 and 8.5 that represent an average expected future and a worst-case scenario. Projected changes in the mean annual wind speed at 100 m, between the historic (1980\textendash 2004) and future (2020\textendash 2044) scenarios are found to vary locally between -5\% and +20\%, whereas for the Wind Energy Density (WED) this variation lies between -15\% and +60\%. Overall, robust and significant increases regarding the mean wind speeds were found mainly over the north and central-western Aegean region, the Island of Crete, as well over Greek mainland and the Ionian Sea. Both scenarios predicted higher statistically significant increases in the Weibull shape parameter values (of about 0.2) in the north\textendash central Aegean, while the summer seasonal analysis, yielded significant decreases over the western Ionian Sea and south and south-western parts of Crete, which might be indicative of more gusty events. Finally, extreme wind speeds analysis indicated increases, which might affect wind turbines structural integrity. \textcopyright{} 2021}

How can we recognise when such misrepresentation occurs and thus avoid it in reasoning about or communicating our uncertainty? And when we should not use a PDF, what should we do instead? In this paper, we address these three questions. We start by providing a classification of types of uncertainty and using this classification to illustrate when PDFs misrepresent our uncertainty in a way that may adversely affect decisions. We then discuss when it is reasonable and appropriate to use a PDF to reason about or communicate uncertainty about climate. We consider two perspectives on this issue. On one, which we argue is preferable, available theory and evidence in climate science basically exclude using PDFs to represent our uncertainty. On the other, PDFs can legitimately be provided when resting on appropriate expert judgement and recognition of associated risks. Once we have specified the border between appropriate and inappropriate uses of PDFs, we explore alternatives to their use. We briefly describe two formal alternatives, namely imprecise probabilities and possibilistic distribution functions, as well as informal possibilistic alternatives. We suggest that the possibilistic alternatives are preferable.}

  abstract = {The ensemble Kalman filter (EnKF) is a computational technique for approximate inference in state-space models. In typical applications, the state vectors are large spatial fields that are observed sequentially over time. The EnKF approximates the Kalman filter by representing the distribution of the state with an ensemble of draws from that distribution. The ensemble members are updated based on newly available data by shifting instead of reweighting, which allows the EnKF to avoid the degeneracy problems of reweighting-based algorithms. Taken together, the ensemble representation and shifting-based updates make the EnKF computationally feasible even for extremely high-dimensional state spaces. The EnKF is successfully used in data-assimilation applications with tens of millions of dimensions. While it implicitly assumes a linear Gaussian state-space model, it has also turned out to be remarkably robust to deviations from these assumptions in many applications. Despite its successes, the EnKF is largely unknown in the statistics community. We aim to change that with the present article, and to entice more statisticians to work on this topic.}

Vecchia approximations of GPs have been used to enable fast evaluation of the likelihood for parameter inference. Here, we study Vecchia approximations of spatial predictions at observed and unobserved locations, including obtaining joint predictive distributions at large sets of locations. We consider a general Vecchia framework for GP predictions, which contains some novel and some existing special cases. We study the accuracy and computational properties of these approaches theoretically and numerically, proving that our new methods exhibit linear computational complexity in the total number of spatial locations. We show that certain choices within the framework can have a strong effect on uncertainty quantification and computational cost, which leads to specific recommendations on which methods are most suitable for various settings. We also apply our methods to a satellite dataset of chlorophyll fluorescence, showing that the new methods are faster or more accurate than existing methods and reduce unrealistic artifacts in prediction maps.

  abstract = {Abstract While internal climate variability is known to affect climate projections, its influence is often underappreciated and confused with model error. Why? In general, modeling centers contribute a small number of realizations to international climate model assessments [e.g., phase 5 of the Coupled Model Intercomparison Project (CMIP5)]. As a result, model error and internal climate variability are difficult, and at times impossible, to disentangle. In response, the Community Earth System Model (CESM) community designed the CESM Large Ensemble (CESM-LE) with the explicit goal of enabling assessment of climate change in the presence of internal climate variability. All CESM-LE simulations use a single CMIP5 model (CESM with the Community Atmosphere Model, version 5). The core simulations replay the twenty to twenty-first century (1920\textendash 2100) 30 times under historical and representative concentration pathway 8.5 external forcing with small initial condition differences. Two companion 1000+-yr-long preindustrial control simulations (fully coupled, prognostic atmosphere and land only) allow assessment of internal climate variability in the absence of climate change. Comprehensive outputs, including many daily fields, are available as single-variable time series on the Earth System Grid for anyone to use. Early results demonstrate the substantial influence of internal climate variability on twentieth- to twenty-first-century climate trajectories. Global warming hiatus decades occur, similar to those recently observed. Internal climate variability alone can produce projection spread comparable to that in CMIP5. Scientists and stakeholders can use CESM-LE outputs to help interpret the observational record, to understand projection spread and to plan for a range of possible futures influenced by both internal climate variability and forced climate change.},

  abstract = {In order to maximise the benefits of green infrastructure in a city's structure for urban adaptation to climate change, there is a need to support decision-makers in the urban design domain with adequate information that would help them to locate such green infrastructure in the most suitable places. Therefore, the aim of this study was to develop a novel decision support system (DSS) for the location of green infrastructure. The goal of the designed solution is to inform users about the location of urban hydrological sinks, which gather stormwater in urban watersheds, and the amount of water which could accumulate in each location depending on the defined precipitation and the soil's moisture conditions. The designed DSS is based on a multicomponent methodology including both atmospheric and soil conditions. The DSS was tested using a sample that presents the results of stormwater accumulation calculations. The obtained results show which green areas are the most suitable locations for green infrastructure solutions and which facility is optimal because of its retention abilities and amount of accumulated stormwater. The application of the designed DSS allows us to maximise the benefits of the implementation of green infrastructure within the existing urban land use. The fully editable component of hydrological conditions allows for testing projections of the potential amount of accumulated water in different precipitation scenarios. The study provides a DSS for use by local authorities which enables them to concentrate actions in order to better adapt cities to climate change and environmental extremes.},

  abstract = {Global financial markets are using applied science to measure, and to guide investments in response to, phenomena attributed to climate change, which influence supply chains, production capacity, and fundamental aspects of supply and demand. Such science and technology, and their integration into markets, are critical for shaping behavior and extending discipline over carbon consumption and excessive risk-taking. There is thus a technology arms race among climate services providers to develop capacity for understanding market, transition, and physical risks across a broad spectrum of asset classes. But the lack of transparent scientific validation and public oversight over rapidly advancing, and often proprietary, ``black box'' technologies are causes of concern, both for the integrity of science and for the potential impacts on consumer behavior and public policy. This paper explores potential pathways for public-sector consumers to extend review authority over such products and services that may be operating outside of the bounds of scientific merit, to balance demands for public transparency, scientific integrity, intellectual property, and commercial enterprise in the broader adaptation of market economies. Public policy grapples with private ``black box'' models Public policy grapples with private ``black box'' models},

In principle, these changes could be predicted if the current state of the ocean were known, but the necessary subsurface observations are lacking. Keenlyside et al. now show that detailed knowledge of the ocean state is not strictly necessary for producing useful predictions on decadal timescales. Their approach, which has proved its worth in 'retro-spective' forecasts, uses existing sea surface temperature observations to improve the forecasting power of climate models. The new model predicts that over the next decade, natural climate variations in the North Atlantic and tropical Pacific oceans will temporarily offset the projected anthropogenic warming: surface temperatures in Europe and North America may even cool a little during this period.}

To address this issue within the context of visualizing environmental data, we list ten guidelines for effective data visualization in scientific publications. These guidelines support the primary objective of data visualization, i.e. to effectively convey information. We believe that this small set of guidelines based on a review of key visualization literature can help researchers improve the communication of their results using effective visualization. Enhancement of environmental data visualization will further improve research presentation and communication within and across disciplines.}

  abstract = {Over the period 2012\textendash 2016, the state of California in the United States (U.S.) experienced a drought considered to be one of the worst in state history. Drought's direct impacts on California's electric power sector are understood. Extremely low streamflow manifests as reduced hydropower availability, and if drought is also marked by elevated temperatures, these can increase building electricity demands for cooling. Collectively, these impacts force system operators to increase reliance on natural gas power plants, increasing market prices and emissions. However, previous investigations have relied mostly on ex post analysis of observational data to develop estimates of increases in costs and carbon dioxide (CO2) emissions due to the 2012\textendash 2016 drought. This has made it difficult to control for confounding variables (e.g. growing renewable energy capacity, volatile natural gas prices) in assessing the drought's impacts. In this study, we use a power system simulation model to isolate the direct impacts of several hydrometeorological phenomena observed during the 2012\textendash 2016 drought on system wide CO2 emissions and wholesale electricity prices in the California market. We find that the impacts of drought conditions on wholesale electricity prices were modest (annual prices increased by 0\textendash 3 MWh-1, although much larger within-year increases are also observed). Instead, it was an increase in natural gas prices, punctuated by the 2014 polar vortex event that affected much of the Eastern U.S., which caused wholesale electricity prices to increase during the drought. Costs from the drought were very different for the state's three investor owned utilities. Overall, we find that increased cooling demands (electricity demand) during the drought may have represented a larger economic cost (3.8 billion) than lost hydropower generation (\$1.9 billion). We also find the potential for renewable energy to mitigate drought-cased increases in CO2 emissions to be negligible, standing in contrast to some previous studies.}

  abstract = {Index insurance has recently been advocated as a useful risk transfer tool for disaster management situations where rapid fiscal relief is desirable and where estimating insured losses may be difficult, time consuming, or subject to manipulation and falsification. For climate-related hazards, a rainfall or temperature index may be proposed. However, rainfall may be highly spatially variable relative to the gauge network, and in many locations, data are inadequate to develop an index because of short time series and the spatial dispersion of stations. In such cases, it may be helpful to consider a climate proxy index as a regional rainfall index. This is particularly useful if a long record is available for the climate index through an independent source and it is well correlated with the regional rainfall hazard. Here El Ni\~no\textendash Southern Oscillation (ENSO) related climate indices are explored for use as a proxy to extreme rainfall in one of the districts of Peru, Piura. The ENSO index insurance product may be purchased by banks or microfinance institutions to aid agricultural damage relief in Peru. Crop losses in the region are highly correlated with floods but are difficult to assess directly. Beyond agriculture, many other sectors suffer as well. Basic infrastructure is destroyed during the most severe events. This disrupts trade for many microenterprises. The reliability and quality of the local rainfall data are variable. Averaging the financial risk across the region is desirable. Some issues with the implementation of the proxy ENSO index are identified and discussed. Specifically, we explore (1) the reliability of the index at different levels of probability of exceedance of maximum seasonal rainfall, (2) the effect of sampling uncertainties and the strength of the proxy's association to local outcome, (3) the potential for clustering of payoffs, (4) the potential that the index could be predicted with some lead time prior to the flood season, and (5) evidence for climate change or nonstationarity in the flood exceedance probability from the long ENSO record.},

The authors use historical 6-h best-track TC datasets and daily precipitation data from 18 607 global rain gauges with at least 25 complete years of data between 1970 and 2014. The highest TC-induced rainfall totals occur in East Asia ({$>$}400 mm yr-1) and northeastern Australia ({$>$}200 mm yr-1), followed by the southeastern United States and along the coast of the Gulf of Mexico (100\textendash 150 mm yr-1). Fractionally, TCs account for 35\%\textendash 50\% of the mean annual rainfall in northwestern Australia, southeastern China, the northern Philippines, and Baja California, Mexico. Seasonally, between 40\% and 50\% of TC-induced rain is recorded along the western coast of Australia and in islands of the south Indian Ocean in the austral summer and in East Asia and Mexico in boreal summer and fall. In terms of extremes, using annual maximum and peak-over-threshold approaches, the highest proportions of TC-induced rainfall are found in East Asia, followed by Australia and North and Central America, with fractional contributions generally decreasing farther inland from the coast. The relationship between TC-induced extreme rainfall and ENSO reveals that TC-induced extreme rainfall tends to occur more frequently in Australia and along the U.S. East Coast during La Ni\~na and in East Asia and the northwestern Pacific islands during El Ni\~no.},

This study evaluates the Atlases compared to new PFEs developed based on the Automated Surface Observing System and Regional Frequency Analysis (ASOS-RFA) as a benchmark and examines a radar-based precipitation product as a data source eligible for developing the post-Atlas. New hydrological insights for the region The stationarity assumption of precipitation was highlighted as a significant factor in increasing the uncertainties in the Atlases. The Atlases explicitly tended to underestimate PFEs compared to the ASOS-RFA. The difference between the Atlases and the ASOS-RFA increases as the return period increases and the duration decreases. The age of the Atlases correlated with the difference, suggesting that recent observations diverge from older estimates. The radar-based PFEs are well-matched with the ASOS-RFA at frequent return periods, but the uncertainties increased as the return period increased. This is because the conventional bias correction was limited in improving the annual maximum series of precipitation. Lastly, we need to pay careful attention to an increase in precipitation frequency estimates shorter than 12-hr durations.}

This study aims to spatially and quantitatively assess the changes in extreme precipitation properties by comparing the NOAA Atlas 14 with a new atlas of precipitation frequency estimates (PFE) developed in this study from early 21st-century records New hydrological insights for the region The NOAA Atlas 14 has quantitatively diverged from the recent 20-year records due to precipitation non-stationarity across the United States. The NOAA Atlas 14 is characterized by more spatially smoothed PFEs compared to the new PFEs, suggesting that employing the NOAA Atlas 14 could lead to an underestimation of physical flood risk at a local scale. As the ``new normal'' in the 21st century, the majority of the United States faces three times more occurrences of extreme storms corresponding to a 1-in-100-year return period of the 20th century. The recent 20-year extreme events should be treated as the new normal. Until the NOAA Atlas 14 is updated to account for climate-driven non-stationarity and can be shown to resolve local effects better, it is recommended to employ new values between the upper and middle bounds of PFE that capture the non-stationarity of precipitation for the regions where the underestimation of PFEs is highlighted in this study}

  abstract = {Observational analysis has indicated a strong connection between the stratospheric Quasi-Biennial oscillation (QBO) and tropospheric Madden-Julian oscillation (MJO), with MJO activity being stronger during the easterly phase than the westerly phase of the QBO. We assess the representation of this QBO-MJO connection in 30 models participating in the Coupled Model Intercomparison Project 6. While some models reasonably simulate the QBO during boreal winter, none of them capture a difference in MJO activity between easterly and westerly QBO that is larger than that which would be expected from the random sampling of internal variability. The weak signal of the simulated QBO-MJO connection may be due to the weaker amplitude of the QBO than observed, especially between 100 to 50 hPa. This weaker amplitude in the models is seen both in the QBO-related zonal wind and temperature, the latter of which is thought to be critical for destabilizing tropical convection.},

To this end, risks arising from uncertainties such as rapidly changing technologies and host government conditions should be carefully addressed. However, traditional methods for economic assessment are not adequate to support decision-making regarding investments in renewable energy. This paper proposes a real options analysis framework as a tool to assess renewable energy investment in developing countries. A case study involving a hydropower project in Indonesia was conducted to validate and verify the proposed framework. This framework is expected to help host countries and investors assess renewable energy projects with high volatility and risk.}

Recent decision-making employs flexible options that can be modified/adjusted over time to address uncertainty. This research analyses a real option based method for assessing adaptation investment timing under coastal flooding and sea-level rise. This method recognises and values the flexibility of waiting as an additional adaptation option under an uncertain future, that is, the key question concerns when the option is best implemented? Real options are applied using a test-case in Lymington (UK), a floodprone coastal town. Our findings show that the option value (i.e., the net value of the overall benefit minus cost) grows with rising sea level to a maximum, which is the optimal time for the adaptation investment. The optimum investment time tends to occur at the same magnitude of sea-level rise (relative to 1990) across most sea-level rise scenarios for the same socio-economic scenario. Hence, monitoring sea-level rise provides important information to plan adaptation. The analysis provides an analytical framework on how and when to implement the adaptation option given the various future scenarios which can be developed further.}

  abstract = {Most cost-benefit analysis (CBA) textbooks and guidelines recognize the objective of CBAs to improve social welfare\textemdash a function of well-being of all individuals, conceptualized by utility. However, today's common practice to value flood risk management benefits as the reduction of the expected annual damages does not comply with this concept of social welfare, since it erroneously focuses on money instead of well-being (utility). Diminishing marginal utility of money implies that risk aversion and income differences should be taken into account while calculating the social welfare benefits of flood risk management. This is especially important when social vulnerability is high, damage compensation is incomplete and the distribution of income is regarded as unfair and income is not redistributed in other ways. Disagreement, misconception, complexity, untrained professionals, political economy and failing guidance are potential reasons why these concepts are not being applied. Compared to the common practice, a theoretically more sound social welfare approach to CBA for flood risk management leads to different conclusions on who to target, what to do, how much to invest and how to share risks, with increased emphasis on resiliency measures for population segments with low income and high social vulnerability. The social welfare approach to CBA, illustrated in this study in the context of floods, can be applied to other climate risks as well, such as storms, droughts, and landslides.

  abstract = {Tropical cyclones are important drivers of coastal flooding which have severe negative public safety and economic consequences. Due to the rare occurrence of such events, high spatial and temporal resolution historical storm precipitation data are limited in availability. This article introduces a statistical tropical cyclone space-time precipitation generator given limited information from storm track datasets. Given a handful of predictor variables that are common in either historical or simulated storm track ensembles such as pressure deficit at the storm's center, radius of maximal winds, storm center and direction, and distance to coast, the proposed stochastic model generates space-time fields of quantitative precipitation over the study domain. Statistically novel aspects include that the model is developed in Lagrangian coordinates with respect to the dynamic storm center that uses ideas from low-rank representations along with circular process models. The model is trained on a set of tropical cyclone data from an advanced weather forecasting model over the Gulf of Mexico and southern United States, and is validated by cross-validation. Results show the model appropriately captures spatial asymmetry of cyclone precipitation patterns, total precipitation as well as the local distribution of precipitation at a set of case study locations along the coast. We additionally compare our model against a widely-used statistical forecast, and illustrate that our approach better captures uncertainty, as well as storm characteristics such as asymmetry.},

It especially offers benefit to simulation-type models, because of the value in being able to build complex models from simple parts, easily calculate robustness measures for simulation statistics and, where appropriate, test hypotheses.

In this paper, the WNTR modeling framework is presented and a case study is described that uses WNTR to simulate the effects of an earthquake on a water distribution system. The case study illustrates that the severity of damage is not only a function of system integrity and earthquake magnitude, but also of the available resources and repair strategies used to return the system to normal operating conditions. While earthquakes are particularly concerning since buried water distribution pipelines are highly susceptible to damage, the software framework can be applied to other types of hazards, including power outages and contamination incidents.}

  abstract = {Current research on flooding risk often focuses on understanding hazards, de-emphasizing the complex pathways of exposure and vulnerability. We investigated the use of both hydrologic and social demographic data for flood exposure mapping with Random Forest (RF) regression and classification algorithms trained to predict both parcel- and tract-level flood insurance claims within New York State, US. Topographic characteristics best described flood claim frequency, but RF prediction skill was improved at both spatial scales when socioeconomic data was incorporated. Substantial improvements occurred at the tract-level when the percentage of minority residents, housing stock value and age, and the political dissimilarity index of voting precincts were used to predict insurance claims. Census tracts with higher numbers of claims and greater densities of low-lying tax parcels tended to have low proportions of minority residents, newer houses, and less political similarity to state level government. We compared this data-driven approach and a physically-based pluvial flood routing model for prediction of the spatial extents of flooding claims in two nearby catchments of differing land use. The floodplain we defined with physically based modeling agreed well with existing federal flood insurance rate maps, but underestimated the spatial extents of historical claim generating areas. In contrast, RF classification incorporating hydrologic and socioeconomic demographic data likely overestimated the flood-exposed areas. Our research indicates that quantitative incorporation of social data can improve flooding exposure estimates.}

  abstract = {Alluvial records of paleofloods show that natural floods resulting from excessive rainfall, snowmelt, or from combined rainfall and snowmelt are highly sensitive to even modest changes of climate equivalent or smaller than changes expected from potential future global warming in the 21st century. The high sensitivity results from effects of hemispheric or global-scale changes in circulation patterns of the ocean and atmosphere to influence the pathways and locations of air masses and storm tracks. Holocene paleoflood chronologies from the Upper Mississippi Valley in the Midwest United States and from the Colorado River drainage of the Southwest United States show that recurrence frequencies of large floods have been subject to abrupt changes over time. These flood chronologies and flood chronologies observed for other middle-latitude regions suggest that recurrence frequencies of large floods are increased when there is an increase in the number of waves and their amplitudes in the middle and upper tropospheric circum-polar westerly circulation. However, some middle-latitude regions on the western margins of continents experience increased frequencies of flooding during strong onshore zonal westerly circulation. Flood chronologies from several regions suggest that times of rapid climate change have a tendency to be associated with more frequent occurrences of large and extreme floods. The unusual high frequencies of large floods that have been observed in many regions since the early 1950s are often attributed to land use change, but the rapid climate forcing from the effects of increased atmospheric greenhouse gases may also be a contributing factor. Paleoflood records provide information that is useful for better interpretation and calibration of modern short-term instrumental records, and they provide unique event-scale information that is useful for calibrating and testing geophysical models of past and anticipated future climate conditions.}

Observations, theory, and models, with increasing robustness, indicate rising global TC risk for some metrics that are projected to impact multiple regions. A 2\textdegree C anthropogenic global warming is projected to impact TC activity as follows. 1) The most confident TC-related projection is that sea level rise accompanying the warming will lead to higher storm inundation levels, assuming all other factors are unchanged. 2) For TC precipitation rates, there is at least medium-to-high confidence in an increase globally, with a median projected increase of 14\%, or close to the rate of tropical water vapor increase with warming, at constant relative humidity. 3) For TC intensity, 10 of 11 authors had at least medium-to-high confidence that the global average will increase. The median projected increase in lifetime maximum surface wind speeds is about 5\% (range: 1\%\textendash 10\%) in available higher-resolution studies. 4) For the global proportion (as opposed to frequency) of TCs that reach very intense (category 4\textendash 5) levels, there is at least medium-to-high confidence in an increase, with a median projected change of +13\%. Author opinion was more mixed and confidence levels lower for the following projections: 5) a further poleward expansion of the latitude of maximum TC intensity in the western North Pacific; 6) a decrease of global TC frequency, as projected in most studies; 7) an increase in global very intense TC frequency (category 4\textendash 5), seen most prominently in higher-resolution models; and 8) a slowdown in TC translation speed.},

  abstract = {Whether the characteristics of tropical cyclones have changed or will change in a warming climate \textemdash{} and if so, how \textemdash{} has been the subject of considerable investigation, often with conflicting results. Large amplitude fluctuations in the frequency and intensity of tropical cyclones greatly complicate both the detection of long-term trends and their attribution to rising levels of atmospheric greenhouse gases. Trend detection is further impeded by substantial limitations in the availability and quality of global historical records of tropical cyclones. Therefore, it remains uncertain whether past changes in tropical cyclone activity have exceeded the variability expected from natural causes. However, future projections based on theory and high-resolution dynamical models consistently indicate that greenhouse warming will cause the globally averaged intensity of tropical cyclones to shift towards stronger storms, with intensity increases of 2\textendash 11\% by 2100. Existing modelling studies also consistently project decreases in the globally averaged frequency of tropical cyclones, by 6\textendash 34\%. Balanced against this, higher resolution modelling studies typically project substantial increases in the frequency of the most intense cyclones, and increases of the order of 20\% in the precipitation rate within 100 km of the storm centre. For all cyclone parameters, projected changes for individual basins show large variations between different modelling studies.}

Interest in community resilience gained momentum following several key natural and human-caused hazards in the United States and worldwide. To date, a comprehensive community resilience model that encompasses the performance of all the physical and socio-economic components from immediate impact through the recovery phase of a natural disaster has not been available. This paper summarizes a literature review of previous community resilience studies with a focus on natural hazards, which includes primarily models of individual infrastructure systems, their interdependencies, and community economic and social systems. A series of national and international initiatives aimed at community resilience are also summarized in this study. This paper suggests extensions of existing modeling methodologies aimed at developing an improved, integrated understanding of resilience that can be used by policy-makers in preparation for future events.}

Whatever the local climate, temperature is an important driver and explains from 25\% to 70\% of the variability. The percentage contribution of temperature to the annual consumption is often greater than 20\%. Air humidity is another important factor, especially in Sahelian cities where its seasonality is large. It explains up to 6.8\% of day-to-day consumption variability in Dakar. The thermal sensitivity is significantly lower than that in OECD countries but when normalized by the base consumption, it is similar. Each additional degree of temperature produces a 3\textendash 4\% increase in the base consumption in Mindelo and Dakar, 6\textendash 10\% in most Sahelian and tropical cities. The percentage consumption increase induced by air humidity can be also significant: in Sahelian and some tropical cities, a 10\% increase in air humidity roughly corresponds to 70\% of the percentage consumption increase induced by a 1~\textdegree C increase in temperature (30\textendash 90\% depending on the city). For most cities, the base consumption and the normalized weather sensitivities are significantly increasing over time, making the electricity demand behavior highly non-stationary.}

Rapid urbanization coinciding with a growing frequency and intensity of floods requires transformative actions in cities worldwide. While abandoning flood prone areas is sometimes discussed as a public climate adaptation option, little attention is paid to studying cumulative impacts of outmigration as an individual choice. To explore the aggregated consequences of households' outmigration decisions in response to increasing flood hazards, we employ a computational agent-based model grounded in empirical heuristics of buyers' and sellers' behaviour in a flood-prone housing market. Our results suggest that pure market-driven processes can cause shifts in demographics in climate-sensitive hotspots placing low-income households further at risk. They get trapped in hazard zones, even when individual risk perceptions and behavioural location preferences are independent of income, suggesting increasing climate gentrification as an outcome of market sorting.}

Effective communication of both types of uncertainty is a key challenge in translating sea-level science to inform long-term coastal planning. Scientific assessments play a key role in the translation process and have taken diverse approaches to communicating sea-level projection uncertainty. Here we review how past IPCC and regional assessments have presented sea-level projection uncertainty, how IPCC presentations have been interpreted by regional assessments and how regional assessments and policy guidance simplify projections for practical use. This information influenced the IPCC Sixth Assessment Report presentation of quantifiable and unquantifiable uncertainty, with the goal of preserving both elements as projections are adapted for regional application. The extent to which sea level will rise under climate change is uncertain, with some of this uncertainty being quantifiable and some unquantifiable. This Review discusses past and present presentations of this uncertainty in IPCC and regional assessments, as well as their influence on users' interpretations.},

  abstract = {Mechanisms such as ice-shelf hydrofracturing and ice-cliff collapse may rapidly increase discharge from marine-based ice sheets. Here, we link a probabilistic framework for sea-level projections to a small ensemble of Antarctic ice-sheet (AIS) simulations incorporating these physical processes to explore their influence on global-mean sea-level (GMSL) and relative sea-level (RSL). We compare the new projections to past results using expert assessment and structured expert elicitation about AIS changes. Under high greenhouse gas emissions (Representative Concentration Pathway [RCP] 8.5), median projected 21st century GMSL rise increases from 79 to 146 cm. Without protective measures, revised median RSL projections would by 2100 submerge land currently home to 153 million people, an increase of 44 million. The use of a physical model, rather than simple parameterizations assuming constant acceleration of ice loss, increases forcing sensitivity: overlap between the central 90\% of simulations for 2100 for RCP 8.5 (93\textendash 243 cm) and RCP 2.6 (26\textendash 98 cm) is minimal. By 2300, the gap between median GMSL estimates for RCP 8.5 and RCP 2.6 reaches {$>$}10 m, with median RSL projections for RCP 8.5 jeopardizing land now occupied by 950 million people (versus 167 million for RCP 2.6). The minimal correlation between the contribution of AIS to GMSL by 2050 and that in 2100 and beyond implies current sea-level observations cannot exclude future extreme outcomes. The sensitivity of post-2050 projections to deeply uncertain physics highlights the need for robust decision and adaptive management frameworks.},

  abstract = {Sea-level rise due to both climate change and non-climatic factors threatens coastal settlements, infrastructure, and ecosystems. Projections of mean global sea-level (GSL) rise provide insufficient information to plan adaptive responses; local decisions require local projections that accommodate different risk tolerances and time frames and that can be linked to storm surge projections. Here we present a global set of local sea-level (LSL) projections to inform decisions on timescales ranging from the coming decades through the 22nd century. We provide complete probability distributions, informed by a combination of expert community assessment, expert elicitation, and process modeling. Between the years 2000 and 2100, we project a very likely (90\% probability) GSL rise of 0.5\textendash 1.2 m under representative concentration pathway (RCP) 8.5, 0.4\textendash 0.9 m under RCP 4.5, and 0.3\textendash 0.8 m under RCP 2.6. Site-to-site differences in LSL projections are due to varying non-climatic background uplift or subsidence, oceanographic effects, and spatially variable responses of the geoid and the lithosphere to shrinking land ice. The Antarctic ice sheet (AIS) constitutes a growing share of variance in GSL and LSL projections. In the global average and at many locations, it is the dominant source of variance in late 21st century projections, though at some sites oceanographic processes contribute the largest share throughout the century. LSL rise dramatically reshapes flood risk, greatly increasing the expected number of ``1-in-10'' and ``1-in-100'' year events.},

Concurrent weather extremes driven by a strongly meandering jet stream could trigger such events, but so far this has not been quantified. Specifically, the ability of state-of-the art crop and climate models to adequately reproduce such high impact events is a crucial component for estimating risks to global food security. Here we find an increased likelihood of concurrent low yields during summers featuring meandering jets in observations and models. While climate models accurately simulate atmospheric patterns, associated surface weather anomalies and negative effects on crop responses are mostly underestimated in bias-adjusted simulations. Given the identified model biases, future assessments of regional and concurrent crop losses from meandering jet states remain highly uncertain. Our results suggest that model-blind spots for such high-impact but deeply-uncertain hazards have to be anticipated and accounted for in meaningful climate risk assessments.},

Despite the recent progress towards deep learning on graphs, event detection on dynamic graphs presents particular challenges to existing architectures. Real-life events are often associated with sudden deviations of the normal behavior of the graph. However, existing approaches for dynamic node embedding are unable to capture the graph-level dynamics related to events. In this paper, we propose DyGED, a simple yet novel deep learning model for event detection on dynamic graphs. DyGED learns correlations between the graph macro dynamics\textemdash i.e. a sequence of graph-level representations\textemdash and labeled events. Moreover, our approach combines structural and temporal selfattention mechanisms to account for application-specific node and time importances effectively. Our experimental evaluation, using representative datasets, demonstrates that DyGED outperforms competing solutions in terms of accuracy by up to 8.5\% while being more scalable than the top alternatives.}

  abstract = {Practices of remapping and rezoning land based on environmental risk are rapidly expanding worldwide. Designating certain urban areas as ``at risk'' in the context of climate change raises familiar conflicts over space and the fraught placement of borders and boundaries. It also gives rise to lesser-studied struggles over time. This article examines such temporal conflicts through a case of disputed risk mapping in New York City. It draws on ethnographic fieldwork over a four-year period after Hurricane Sandy, when the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) was revising the city's Flood Insurance Rate Maps, or FIRMs. FIRMs divide land into zones of risk to set insurance rates and building standards. They dictate how high exposed homes must be elevated and who can afford to live in them. This article adds to work on the social consequences of risk mapping, which in FEMA's case is occurring in conjunction with changes to the National Flood Insurance Program that portend rate hikes for many households. Foregrounding the lived experience of being mapped into a flood zone, the article analyzes conflicts over how FIRMs represent risk, redistribute uncertainty, and reorient collective action in ways that threaten to hinder movement toward more flood-adapted futures. While maps are key to rendering the risks of climate change vivid and local, their use as technologies of governing adaptation produces its own contested effects, centered in part on competing temporalities like the flood-zone temporalities examined here.}

However, there is a need to reconsider these relationships in light of accelerating climate change and associated social and policy shifts in the USA, including the rising cost of flood insurance, the challenge of obtaining aid to rebuild, and growing interest in ``managed retreat'' from places at greatest risk. This article presents data from a survey of individuals who opted either to rebuild in place or relocate with the help of a voluntary home buyout after Hurricane Sandy. Findings show those who lived in buyout-eligible areas and relocated were significantly less likely to report worsened stress than those who rebuilt in place. This suggests access to a government-supported voluntary relocation option may, under certain circumstances, lessen the negative mental health consequences associated with disaster-related housing damage.}

To counter the second limitation, a dozen climate-modeling groups have recently performed the same highly controlled numerical experiment as part of a coordinated comparison project. This allows a multimodel estimation of the regions on Earth where precipitation is affected by soil moisture anomalies during Northern Hemisphere summer. Potential benefits of this estimation may include improved seasonal rainfall forecasts. An ensemble of 12 climate models shows that precipitation is most influenced by soil moisture in the Great Plains, Sahel, and India, allowing for better weather prediction.

We estimate the opportunity costs, the avoided flood damages, and the capitalization of proximity to protected lands into nearby home prices. To estimate avoided flood damages, we undertake a parcel-level analysis using the Hazus-MH flood model, a GIS-based model developed for FEMA that couples a hydrology and hydraulics model with a damage model relating flood depths to property damage. We examine the distribution of damages across parcels, demonstrating that careful spatial targeting can increase the net benefits of floodplain conservation. In addition, we estimate a hedonic model and find that the increased property values for homes near protected lands are more than three times larger than the avoided flood damages, stressing the continued importance of more traditional conservation values. The proximity benefits alone exceed the opportunity costs; the avoided flood damages further strengthen the economic case for floodplain conservation.}

Ultimately, Congress reversed course and reinstated discounted rates for certain classes of policyholders. We examine the tension between risk-based rates and affordability through a case study of Ocean County, New Jersey, an area heavily damaged by Hurricane Sandy. We argue that the NFIP must address affordability, but that this should not be done through discounted premiums.

Specific forms of this formula are explicitly derived from the underlying probability distribution function of maximum intensities. Several appropriate distribution functions are studied for that purpose. Simple analytical approximations of the most common distribution functions are presented, which are incorporated in, and allow mathematically convenient expressions of idf relationships. Also, two methods for a reliable parameter estimation of idf relationships are proposed. The proposed formulation of idf relationships constitutes an efficient parameterisation, facilitating the description of the geographical variability and regionalisation of idf curves. Moreover, it allows incorporating data from non-recording stations, thus remedying the problem of establishing idf curves in places with a sparse network of rain-recording stations, using data of the denser network of non-recording stations. Case studies, based on data of a significant part of Greece, briefly presented in the paper, clarify the methodology for the construction and regionalisation of the idf relationship.}

Climate changes are closely related to the Hurst phenomenon, which has been detected in many long hydroclimatic time series and is stochastically equivalent to a simple scaling behaviour of climate variability over time scale. The climate variability, anthropogenic or natural, increases the uncertainty of the hydrological processes. It is shown that hydrological statistics, the branch of hydrology that deals with uncertainty, in its current state is not consistent with the varying character of climate. Typical statistics used in hydrology such as means, variances, cross- and autocorrelations and Hurst coefficients, and the variability thereof, are revisited under the hypothesis of a varying climate following a simple scaling law, and new estimators are studied which, in many cases, differ dramatically from the classical ones. The new statistical framework is applied to real-world examples for typical tasks such as estimation and hypothesis testing where, again, the results depart significantly from those of the classical statistics.}

The observed internal variability so estimated exhibits a pronounced multidecadal mode with a distinctive spatiotemporal signature, which is altogether absent in model simulations.

  abstract = {Building houses in inundation areas is always a risk, since absolute flood protection is impossible. Where settlements already exist, flood damage must be kept as small as possible. Suitable means are precautionary measures such as elevated building configuration or flood adapted use. However, data about the effects of such measures are rare, and consequently, the efficiency of different precautionary measures is unclear. To improve the knowledge about efficient precautionary measures, approximately 1200 private households, which were affected by the 2002 flood at the river Elbe and its tributaries, were interviewed about the flood damage of their buildings and contents as well as about their precautionary measures. The affected households had little flood experience, i.e. only 15\% had experienced a flood before. 59\% of the households stated that they did not know, that they live in a flood prone area. Thus, people were not well prepared, e.g. just 11\% had used and furnished their house in a flood adapted way and only 6\% had a flood adapted building structure. Building precautionary measures are mainly effective in areas with frequent small floods. But also during the extreme flood event in 2002 building measures reduced the flood loss. From the six different building precautionary measures under study, flood adapted use and adapted interior fitting were the most effective ones. They reduced the damage ratio for buildings by 46\% and 53\%, respectively. The damage ratio for contents was reduced by 48\% due to flood adapted use and by 53\% due to flood adapted interior fitting. The 2002 flood motivated a relatively large number of people to implement private precautionary measures, but still much more could be done. Hence, to further reduce flood losses, people's motivation to invest in precaution should be improved. More information campaigns and financial incentives should be issued to encourage precautionary measures.}

  abstract = {Socio-economic scenarios constitute an important tool for exploring the long-term consequences of anthropogenic climate change and available response options. A more consistent use of socio-economic scenarios that would allow an integrated perspective on mitigation, adaptation and residual climate impacts remains a major challenge. We assert that the identification of a set of global narratives and socio-economic pathways offering scalability to different regional contexts, a reasonable coverage of key socio-economic dimensions and relevant futures, and a sophisticated approach to separating climate policy from counter-factual ``no policy'' scenarios would be an important step toward meeting this challenge. To this end, we introduce the concept of ``shared socio-economic (reference) pathways''. Sufficient coverage of the relevant socio-economic dimensions may be achieved by locating the pathways along the dimensions of challenges to mitigation and to adaptation. The pathways should be specified in an iterative manner and with close collaboration between integrated assessment modelers and impact, adaptation and vulnerability researchers to assure coverage of key dimensions, sufficient scalability and widespread adoption. They can be used not only as inputs to analyses, but also to collect the results of different climate change analyses in a matrix defined by two dimensions: climate exposure as characterized by a radiative forcing or temperature level and socio-economic development as classified by the pathways. For some applications, socio-economic pathways may have to be augmented by ``shared climate policy assumptions'' capturing global components of climate policies that some studies may require as inputs. We conclude that the development of shared socio-economic (reference) pathways, and integrated socio-economic scenarios more broadly, is a useful focal point for collaborative efforts between integrated assessment and impact, adaptation and vulnerability researchers.}

  abstract = {Issues of scaling characteristics in spatial rainfall have attracted increasing attention over the last decade. Several methods based on simple and multiscaling and multifractal ideas have been proposed and parameter estimation techniques developed for the hypothesized models. Simulations based on these models have realistic resemblance to ``generic rainfall fields.'' In this research we analyze rainfall data for scaling characteristics without an a priori assumed model. We look at the behavior of rainfall fluctuations obtained at several scales, via orthogonal wavelet transform of the data, to infer the precise nature of scaling exhibited by spatial rainfall. The essential idea behind the analysis is to segregate large-scale (long wavelength) features from small-scale features and study each of them independently. The hypothesis is set forward that rainfall might exhibit scaling in small-scale fluctuations, if at all, and at large scale this behavior will break down to accommodate the effects of external factors affecting the particular rain-producing mechanism. The validity of this hypothesis is examined. In the first of these papers we develop the methodology for the segregation of large- and small-scale features and apply it to a severe spring time midlatitude squall line storm. The second paper (Kumar and Foufoula-Georgiou, this issue) develops a framework for testing the presence and studying the nature of self-similarity in the fluctuations.}

  abstract = {The basis for all knowledge is ``information'' that we compile about the world, expressed through models that support understanding, prediction, and decision making. This overview paper provides a contextual basis for the four papers that make up the ``debate series'' compiled under the above title. We briefly introduce Information Theory, discuss how ``information'' can be considered to be both a ``physical'' quantity and a ``probabilistic'' basis for representing incompleteness in knowledge, discuss the core motivation for this debate series, and briefly summarize the major arguments advanced by each of the debate papers. Our purpose is to facilitate an understanding of how these papers are related and how they approach the debate series question from different perspectives, while pointing to future directions for research. Finally, we invite further discourse and debate to advance the understanding and prediction of natural system dynamics using Information Theory, including the assessment of its limitations and complementarity to existing physics and machine learning approaches. Ultimately, our goal is to press for the development of philosophical and methodological advances that will enable the Earth science community to address some of the compelling unsolved problems in our field.},

  abstract = {Flood damages have exhibited a rapid upward trend, both globally and in Europe, faster than population and economic growth. Hence, vigorous attempts of attribution of changes have been made. Flood risk and vulnerability tend to change over many areas, due to a range of climatic and nonclimatic impacts whose relative importance is site-specific. Flooding is a complex phenomenon and there are several generating mechanisms, among others intense and/or long-lasting precipitation, snowmelt, ice jam. Projected climate-driven changes in future flood frequency are complex, depending on the generating mechanism, e.g., increasing flood magnitudes where floods result of heavy rainfall and possibly decreasing magnitudes where floods are generated by spring snowmelt. Climate change is likely to cause an increase of the risk of riverine flooding across much of Europe. Projections of flood hazard in Europe based on climatic and hydrological models, reviewed in this paper, illustrate possible changes of recurrence of a 100-year flood (with probability of exceedance being 1-in-100~years) in Europe. What used to be a 100-year flood in the control period is projected to become either more frequent or less frequent in the future time horizon of concern. For a large part of the continent, large flooding is projected to become more commonplace in future, warmer climate. Due to the large uncertainty of climate projections, it is currently not possible to devise a scientifically-sound procedure for redefining design floods (e.g. 100-year flood) in order to adjust flood defenses. For the time being, we recommend to adjust design floods using a ``climate change factor'' approach.}

Changes in the sign of the trend of EP vary by region as well as by ARI and duration, despite the statistically significant upward trends for all combinations of EP thresholds when area averaged across the contiguous United States. Spatially, there is a pronounced east-to-west gradient in the trends of the EP with strong upward trends east of the Rocky Mountains. In general, upward trends are larger and more significant for longer ARIs, but the contribution to the trend in total seasonal and annual precipitation is significantly larger for shorter ARIs because they occur more frequently. Across much of the contiguous United States, upward trends of warm-season EP are substantially larger than those for the cold season and have a substantially greater effect on the annual trend in total precipitation. This result occurs even in areas where the total precipitation is nearly evenly divided between the cold and warm seasons. When compared with short-duration events, long-duration events\textemdash for example, 30 days\textemdash contribute the most to annual trends. Coincident statistically significant upward trends of EP and precipitable water (PW) occur in many regions, especially during the warm season. Increases in PW are likely to be one of several factors responsible for the increase in EP (and average total precipitation) observed in many areas across the contiguous United States.},

To first approximation, EP scales linearly with PW, but there is nonlinear scaling at the lower and upper ends of the PW distribution. On average, EP is amplified by twice the amount of PW, but there is substantial seasonal and spatial variability caused by dynamically forced vertical velocity with stations ranging from a one-to-one relationship to over three-to-one. These latter stations are generally found in elevated terrain or near coasts and in regions and seasons affected by strong synoptic-scale weather systems. The results also point to PW, not vertical velocity, as the key limiting factor in the most intense EP events. This has important implications for projecting changes of the most intense EP events in a warmer world.}

Several behavioural biases lead decision-makers not to invest in adaptation measures until after it is too late. In an interdependent world with no intervention by the public sector, it may be economically rational for those at risk not to invest in protective measures. Risk management strategies that involve private-public partnerships that address these issues may help in reducing future catastrophic losses. These may include multi-year insurance contracts, well-enforced regulations, third-party inspections, and alternative risk transfer instruments such as catastrophe bonds.}

An increasing amount of research has been devoted to the analysis of the costs of climate change and its mitigation, as well as to the design of policies, such as the international Kyoto Protocol, post-Kyoto negotiations, regional initiatives, and unilateral actions. Although most studies on climate change policies in economics have considered efficiency aspects, there is a growing literature on equity and justice. Climate change policy has important dimensions of distributive justice, both within and across generations, but in this paper we survey only studies on the intragenerational aspect, i.e., within a generation. We cover several domains including the international, regional, national, sectoral and inter-personal, and examine aspects such as the distribution of burdens from climate change, climate change policy negotiations in general, implementation of climate agreements using tradable emission permits, and the uncertainty of alternatives to emission reductions.}

It has been developed mainly for model-based decision support. This paper investigates the extent to which EMA is a promising approach for future oriented technology analysis (FTA). We report on three applications of EMA, using different modeling approaches, in three different technical domains. In the first case, EMA is combined with System Dynamics (SD) to study plausible dynamics for mineral and metal scarcity. The main purpose of this combination of EMA and SD is to gain insight into what kinds of surprising dynamics can occur given a variety of uncertainties and a basic understanding of the system. In the second case, EMA is combined with a hybrid model for airport performance calculations to develop an adaptive strategic plan. This case shows how one can iteratively improve a strategic plan through the identification of plausible external conditions that would cause the plan to perform poorly. In the final case, EMA is combined with an agent-based model to study transition dynamics in the electricity sector and identify crucial factors that positively and negatively affect a transition towards more sustainable functioning of the electricity sector. This paper concludes that EMA is useful for generating foresights and studying systemic and structural transformations despite the presence of a plethora of uncertainties, and for designing robust policies and plans, which are key activities of FTA.}

To deal with these uncertainties, dynamic adaptive policies that can be changed over time are suggested. This paper presents a model-driven approach supporting the development of promising adaptation pathways, and illustrates the approach using a hypothetical case. We use robust optimization over uncertainties related to climate change, land use, cause-effect relations, and policy efficacy, to identify the most promising pathways. For this purpose, we generate an ensemble of possible futures and evaluate candidate pathways over this ensemble using an Integrated Assessment Meta Model. We understand `most promising' in terms of the robustness of the performance of the candidate pathways on multiple objectives, and use a multi-objective evolutionary algorithm to find the set of most promising pathways. This results in an adaptation map showing the set of most promising adaptation pathways and options for transferring from one pathway to another. Given the pathways and signposts, decision-makers can make an informed decision on a dynamic adaptive plan in a changing environment that is able to achieve their intended objectives despite the myriad of uncertainties.}

The results indicate that the two approaches are complementary. Robust Decision-Making offers insights into conditions under which problems occur, and makes trade-offs transparent. The Dynamic Adaptive Policy Pathways approach emphasizes dynamic adaptation over time, and thus offers a natural way for handling the vulnerabilities identified through Robust Decision-Making. The application also makes clear that the analytical process of Robust Decision-Making is path-dependent and open ended: an analyst has to make many choices, for which Robust Decision-Making offers no direct guidance.}

  abstract = {Scenario discovery is a model-based approach for scenario development, aimed at finding one or more subspaces within the uncertainty space associated with a model that is decision-relevant. These identified subspaces can subsequently be translated into narratives or shared in other ways a broader participatory process. Finding such as subspace involves solving a three-objective optimization problem. A subspace should cover many of the decision relevant model runs, while containing as few as possible nondecision relevant model runs, and being easy to interpret. Existing techniques for scenario discovery, however, focus only on finding a subspace that minimizes the number of nondecision relevant model runs. Adopting a single objective optimization approach for a many-objective optimization problem implies that the full trade-off space is not identified. In this paper, we introduce a many-objective optimization approach for scenario discovery. We compare this with an improved usage of Patient Rule Induction Method (PRIM) for identifying the multidimensional trade-offs amongst coverage, density, and interpretability. We find that the many-objective optimization approach produces results which slightly dominate those of the improved version of PRIM on all three objectives. Qualitatively, however, both approaches identify essentially the same subspaces. The prime benefits of the many-objective optimization approach are its potential in bringing additional scenario relevant concerns such as consistency or diversity into the scenario discovery framework, as well as its ability to avoid overfitting. Potentially more important, it also paves the way for future work on using more sophisticated metaheuristic optimization approaches for scenario discovery.},

  abstract = {Concerns about the potential effects of anthropogenic climate change have led to a closer examination of how climate varies in the long run, and how such variations may impact rainfall variations at daily to seasonal time scales. For South Florida in particular, the influences of the low-frequency climate phenomena, such as the El Nino Southern Oscillation (ENSO) and the Atlantic Multi-decadal Oscillation (AMO), have been identified with aggregate annual or seasonal rainfall variations. Since the combined effect of these variations is manifest as persistent multi-year variations in rainfall, the question of modeling these variations at the time and space scales relevant for use with the daily time step-driven hydrologic models in use by the South Florida Water Management District (SFWMD) has arisen. To address this problem, a general methodology for the hierarchical modeling of low- and high-frequency phenomenon at multiple rain gauge locations is developed and illustrated. The essential strategy is to use long-term proxies for regional climate to first develop stochastic scenarios for regional climate that include the low-frequency variations driving the regional rainfall process, and then to use these indicators to condition the concurrent simulation of daily rainfall at all rain gauges under consideration. A newly developed methodology, called Wavelet Autoregressive Modeling (WARM), is used in the first step after suitable climate proxies for regional rainfall are identified. These proxies typically have data available for a century to four centuries so that long-term quasi-periodic climate modes of interest can be identified more reliably. Correlation analyses with seasonal rainfall in the region are used to identify the specific proxies considered as candidates for subsequent conditioning of daily rainfall attributes using a Non-homogeneous hidden Markov model (NHMM). The combined strategy is illustrated for the May\textendash June\textendash July (MJJ) season. The details of the modeling methods and results for the MJJ season are presented in this study.}

These are compared with a more direct emulation strategy, namely running the coupled computer models and directly emulating the system; perhaps surprisingly, this direct emulator was inferior in all illustrations.

Here, we perform a variance decomposition to partition uncertainty in global climate projections and quantify the relative importance of downscaling and bias-correction. We analyze simple climate metrics such as annual temperature and precipitation averages, as well as several indices of climate extremes. We find that downscaling and bias-correction often contribute substantial uncertainty to local decision-relevant climate outcomes, though our results are strongly heterogeneous across space, time, and climate metrics. Our results can provide guidance to impact modelers and decision-makers regarding the uncertainties associated with downscaling and bias-correction when performing local-scale analyses, as neglecting to account for these uncertainties may risk overconfidence relative to the full range of possible climate futures.},

  abstract = {Depletion and pollution of groundwater, Earth's largest and most accessible freshwater stock, is a global sustainability concern. A changing climate, marked by more frequent and intense hydrologic extremes, poses threats to groundwater recharge and amplifies groundwater use. However, widespread human development and contamination of groundwater reservoirs pose an immediate threat of resource extinction with impacts in many regions with dense population or intensive agriculture. A rapid increase in global groundwater studies has emerged, but this has also highlighted the extreme paucity of data for substantive trend analyses and assessment of the state of the global resource. Noting the difficulty in seeing and measuring this typically invisible resource, we discuss factors that determine the current state of global groundwater, including the uncertainties accompanying data and modeling, with an eye to identifying emerging issues and the prospects for informing local to global resource management in critical regions. We comment on some prospective management strategies. Expected final online publication date for the Annual Review of Environment and Resources, Volume 45 is October 19, 2020.

  abstract = {We introduce a machine-learning (ML)-based weather simulator--called "GraphCast"--which outperforms the most accurate deterministic operational medium-range weather forecasting system in the world, as well as all previous ML baselines. GraphCast is an autoregressive model, based on graph neural networks and a novel high-resolution multi-scale mesh representation, which we trained on historical weather data from the European Centre for Medium-Range Weather Forecasts (ECMWF)'s ERA5 reanalysis archive. It can make 10-day forecasts, at 6-hour time intervals, of five surface variables and six atmospheric variables, each at 37 vertical pressure levels, on a 0.25-degree latitude-longitude grid, which corresponds to roughly 25 x 25 kilometer resolution at the equator. Our results show GraphCast is more accurate than ECMWF's deterministic operational forecasting system, HRES, on 90.0\% of the 2760 variable and lead time combinations we evaluated. GraphCast also outperforms the most accurate previous ML-based weather forecasting model on 99.2\% of the 252 targets it reported. GraphCast can generate a 10-day forecast (35 gigabytes of data) in under 60 seconds on Cloud TPU v4 hardware. Unlike traditional forecasting methods, ML-based forecasting scales well with data: by training on bigger, higher quality, and more recent data, the skill of the forecasts can improve. Together these results represent a key step forward in complementing and improving weather modeling with ML, open new opportunities for fast, accurate forecasting, and help realize the promise of ML-based simulation in the physical sciences.}

  abstract = {Zero-inflated Poisson (ZIP) regression is a model for count data with excess zeros. It assumes that with probability p the only possible observation is 0, and with probability 1 \textendash{} p, a Poisson({$\lambda$}) random variable is observed. For example, when manufacturing equipment is properly aligned, defects may be nearly impossible. But when it is misaligned, defects may occur according to a Poisson({$\lambda$}) distribution. Both the probability p of the perfect, zero defect state and the mean number of defects {$\lambda$} in the imperfect state may depend on covariates. Sometimes p and {$\lambda$} are unrelated; other times p is a simple function of {$\lambda$} such as p = l/(1 + {$\lambda$} T ) for an unknown constant T . In either case, ZIP regression models are easy to fit. The maximum likelihood estimates (MLE's) are approximately normal in large samples, and confidence intervals can be constructed by inverting likelihood ratio tests or using the approximate normality of the MLE's. Simulations suggest that the confidence intervals based on likelihood ratio tests are better, however. Finally, ZIP regression models are not only easy to interpret, but they can also lead to more refined data analyses. For example, in an experiment concerning soldering defects on printed wiring boards, two sets of conditions gave about the same mean number of defects, but the perfect state was more likely under one set of conditions and the mean number of defects in the imperfect state was smaller under the other set of conditions; that is, ZIP regression can show not only which conditions give lower mean number of defects but also why the means are lower.}

  abstract = {An analytic scenario generation framework is developed based on the idea that the same climate outcome can result from very different socioeconomic and policy drivers. The framework builds on the Scenario Matrix Framework's abstraction of ``challenges to mitigation'' and ``challenges to adaptation'' to facilitate the flexible discovery of diverse and consequential scenarios. We combine visual and statistical techniques for interrogating a large factorial data set of 33,750 scenarios generated using the Global Change Assessment Model. We demonstrate how the analytic framework can aid in identifying which scenario assumptions are most tied to user-specified measures for policy relevant outcomes of interest, specifically for our example high or low mitigation costs. We show that the current approach for selecting reference scenarios can miss policy relevant scenario narratives that often emerge as hybrids of optimistic and pessimistic scenario assumptions. We also show that the same scenario assumption can be associated with both high and low mitigation costs depending on the climate outcome of interest and the mitigation policy context. In the illustrative example, we show how agricultural productivity, population growth, and economic growth are most predictive of the level of mitigation costs. Formulating policy relevant scenarios of deeply and broadly uncertain futures benefits from large ensemble-based exploration of quantitative measures of consequences. To this end, we have contributed a large database of climate change futures that can support ``bottom-up'' scenario generation techniques that capture a broader array of consequences than those that emerge from limited sampling of a few reference scenarios.},

  abstract = {We assess the potential financial benefits of rooftop rainwater harvesting (RWH) in Mexico City from the perspective of property owners and entrepreneurs. A bottom-up approach was followed by evaluating RWH at individual buildings and aggregating the results to a borough/city level. We consider sector-specific water demands, potable and nonpotable uses, and user-specific water tariffs. We find that RWH is economically most beneficial for nondomestic users rather than for small domestic users, who are often the target of RWH interventions. Based on a net present value analysis, a potable RWH system is not favored for most domestic users under the current subsidized municipal water tariff structure. Our analysis only considers capital and maintenance expenses, and not other benefits related to increased access to water and reliability, or social benefits from a switch to a RWH system. If the initial capital expense for RWH is partly financed by transferring the water subsidy to an entrepreneur, then RWH becomes financially attractive for a wide range of domestic users. To improve water access in Mexico City, RWH is attractive in the most marginalized boroughs where water use is currently lower and precipitation is higher. For domestic users relying on trucked water, RWH can have great financial benefits. Our approach provides quantitative data with high spatial specificity, highlighting the places and types of users that would benefit most from RWH.},

  abstract = {Many open questions and unresolved issues surround the topic of bias correction (BC) in climate change impact studies (CCIS). One question relates to the contribution of downscaling of climate change scenarios on the uncertainties in results obtained using impact models for agriculture. In particular, for large area or regional agricultural impact assessments, the question of bias correction is of high relevance. Relatively few studies exist looking at the quantification of the impacts of BC methods in general circulation model (GCM) and regional climate model (RCM) data on results of such impact studies. Here, we quantify the impact of different BC methods on temperature (T) and precipitation (P) from different CORDEX GCM-RCM combinations, and how the debiased T\&P signal may propagate through agricultural impact models. Specifically, we estimate the impact of BC on (i) an empirical P- and fuzzy rule-based algorithm to estimate the crop planting date, and (ii) a mechanistic T\&P-based approach to quantify the crop suitability index (CSI) for the main staple crops in West Africa (i.e. groundnut, maize, pearl millet, sorghum). Both approaches serve as a proxy for more complex process-based ecophysiological crop models. Depending on the choice of the BC method, the uncertainties in the assessment of the CSI can be more than twice as high compared to the uncertainties from the GCM-RCM model selection. Comparing the estimated CSI values with observed harvest area, it is found that BC generally improves the performance for models with low hit rates ({$<$}30\textendash 35\%), but decreases the performance for models with relatively high hit rates ({$>$}35\%). Such consequences can also be expected for process-based crop models, which are developed to operate on field-scale but are driven by coarser scale RCMs. It is concluded that such agriculturally oriented climate impact models as investigated here should be interpreted with great caution if applied without BC or relying on a single BC approach only. Rather, we suggest to include different BC approaches in the generation of climate projections for CCIS and quantify their uncertainties following a super-ensemble probabilistic assessment.}

Here, we focus on the Holocene epoch and show that ENSO amplitude and frequency intensified over this period, driven by an increase in extreme El Ni\~no events. Our study combines new climate model simulations, advances in coral proxy system modeling, and coral proxy data from the central tropical Pacific. Although the model diverges from the observed coral data regarding the exact magnitude of change, both indicate that modern ENSO variance eclipsed paleo-estimates over the Holocene, albeit against the backdrop of wide-ranging natural variability. Toward further constraining paleo-ENSO, our work underscores the need for multimodel investigations of additional Holocene intervals alongside more coral data from periods with larger climate forcing. Our findings implicate extreme El Ni\~no events as an important rectifier of mean ENSO intensity.}

Approaches have been developed for this type of problem, one of which, Dynamic Adaptive Policy Pathways approach (DAPP), has been applied in practice in a limited number of circumstances, mainly for large infrastructure projects and at national scales. To better understand what it takes to catalyse uptake of DAPP to better address uncertainty and change than typical static planning approaches, we examined the role of a simulation game facilitated by a knowledge broker, in a real-life local decision setting on flood risk management in New Zealand. Four intervention phases over four years are described and their influence analysed: 1) creating interest through framing the science, 2) increasing awareness using the Game, 3) experimenting with DAPP, and 4) uptake of DAPP. We found that a knowledge broker introducing new framing of changing risk profiles, facilitating use of the Game and the DAPP approach in a real-life decision making setting, with contextual support from events and (inter)national reports, catalysed the uptake of adaptive pathways planning. We identified enabling requirements necessary for embedding adaptive planning into decision-making practice for addressing uncertainty and change.}

Kernel based machine learning algorithms are typically applied to data that is not linearly separable in its original space. Although kernel methods are among the most elegant part of machine learning, it is challenging for users to define or select a proper kernel function with optimized parameter settings for their data. In this paper, we propose a novel method called Deep Kernel that can automatically learn a kernel function from data using deep learning. The deep kernel is currently utilized in classification, and dimension reduction and visualization. For the classification task, we evaluate the deep kernel method by comparing its performance with the optimized Gaussian kernels, both using support vector machines as the decision model, on different types of datasets. The experimental results show that the proposed deep kernel method outperforms the traditional methods with Gaussian kernels on most of the data sets. For the dimension reduction and visualization task, the deep kernel is used along with kernel PCA. The results are also compared and contrasted with using the RBF kernel with multiple parameters. The deep kernel is shown to be more powerful in dimension reduction and visualization than the RBF kernel.}

While past research has portrayed FIRMs as static maps, property residents and community representatives can propose changes to flood zones on FIRMs. These changes add and remove buildings from flood zones on FIRMs, which raises an important question: are there discernable trends or patterns in these alterations to FIRMs? We use Geographic Information Systems FIRM layers and building footprints to quantify the number of buildings moved in and out of the Special Flood Hazard Area (SFHA) for recently updated FIRMs. Our analysis of building additions and removals from SFHAs at county and census tract scales shows there has been a net change of over 20,000 buildings removed from these SFHAs between preliminary and present FIRM iterations. We also find that SFHAs are more frequently altered in places where median home values are higher, buildings are newer, and percentage of white populations are higher. These findings suggest changes to flood zones on FIRMs occur more often where people have greater socioeconomic means, raising questions of equity for future FIRM appeals and revisions.}

  abstract = {Extreme precipitation events are arguably one of the most important natural hazards in many areas of the globe, impacting nearly every societal sector. In the Northeastern United States, extreme precipitation events have been shown to be increasing with several recent events garnering national attention (i.e., Ellicott City Maryland 2018; Tropical Storm Lee 2011). The NOAA Atlas 14 product is the nation's standard for estimating the magnitude and frequency of site-specific extreme precipitation events, containing both precipitation frequency estimates, as well as associated confidence intervals. The Atlas uses surface stations, primarily from the National Weather Service Cooperative Observer Program, and statistical methodologies to provide point-based precipitation exceedance probability estimates for several durations and potential recurrence intervals. Unfortunately, the number and quality of Cooperative Observer sites varies greatly over space and time. This research compares observed precipitation extremes from a high-resolution statewide mesonet to those estimated by the Atlas 14 product for a 10-year recurrence interval at several precipitation durations. Results of the analysis indicate that Atlas 14 underestimates the number and magnitude of extreme precipitation events across the state of Delaware at longer event durations (360- to 1,440-min). At shorter durations (5- to 240-min) the Atlas 14 estimates are more closely aligned with the observations from the high-resolution precipitation network. These results suggest that caution should be exercised when using Atlas 14 estimates for engineering standards and hydrologic studies, especially for longer duration events. Therefore, a more rapid update cycle for revision of the Atlas 14 product should be considered, as a changing climate regime may be responsible for the differences identified in this research.},

For accurate assessments, several other factors must be considered as well, such as the variability of sea-level rise and storm surge patterns. Here, a global sensitivity analysis is used to provide quantitative insight into the relative importance of contributing uncertainties over the coming decades. The method is applied on an urban low-lying coastal site located in the north-western Mediterranean, where the yearly probability of damaging flooding could grow drastically after 2050 if sea-level rise follows IPCC projections. Storm surge propagation processes, then sea-level variability, and, later, global sea-level rise scenarios become successively important source of uncertainties over the 21st century. This defines research priorities that depend on the target period of interest. On the long term, scenarios RCP 6.0 and 8.0 challenge local capacities of adaptation for the considered site.}

  abstract = {Regional climate models are increasingly used to add small-scale features that are not present in their lateral boundary conditions (LBC). It is well known that the limited area over which a model is integrated must be large enough to allow the full development of small-scale features. On the other hand, integrations on very large domains have shown important departures from the driving data, unless large scale nudging is applied. The issue of domain size is studied here by using the ``perfect model'' approach. This method consists first of generating a high-resolution climatic simulation, nicknamed big brother (BB), over a large domain of integration. The next step is to degrade this dataset with a low-pass filter emulating the usual coarse-resolution LBC. The filtered nesting data (FBB) are hence used to drive a set of four simulations (LBs for Little Brothers), with the same model, but on progressively smaller domain sizes. The LB statistics for a climate sample of four winter months are compared with BB over a common region. The time average (stationary) and transient-eddy standard deviation patterns of the LB atmospheric fields generally improve in terms of spatial correlation with the reference (BB) when domain gets smaller. The extraction of the small-scale features by using a spectral filter allows detecting important underestimations of the transient-eddy variability in the vicinity of the inflow boundary, which can penalize the use of small domains (less than 100 \texttimes{} 100 grid points). The permanent ``spatial spin-up'' corresponds to the characteristic distance that the large-scale flow needs to travel before developing small-scale features. The spin-up distance tends to grow in size at higher levels in the atmosphere.}

They make short-term assessments of electricity demand on the basis of historical weather over the last two decades, thereby ignoring the effects of climate change and the possibility of weather variability outside the recent historical range. In this paper, we develop an empirical method to predict the impact of weather on energy demand. We use that with a large ensemble of climate model runs to construct a probability distribution of power demand on the ERCOT grid for summer and winter 2021. We find that the most severe weather events will use 100\% of available power\textemdash if anything goes wrong, as it did during the 2021 winter, there will not be sufficient available power. More quantitatively, we estimate a 5\% chance that maximum power demand would be within 4.3 and 7.9 GW of ERCOT's estimate of best-case available resources during summer and winter 2021, respectively, and a 20\% chance it would be within 7.1 and 17 GW. The shortage of power on the ERCOT grid is partially hidden by the fact that ERCOTs seasonal assessments, which are based entirely on historical weather, are too low. Prior to the 2021 winter blackout, ERCOT forecast an extreme peak load of 67 GW. In reality, we estimate hourly peak demand was 82 GW, 22\% above ERCOT's most extreme forecast and about equal to the best-case available power. Given the high stakes, ERCOT should develop probabilistic estimates using modern scientific tools to predict the range of power demand more accurately.},

  abstract = {A new statistical-dynamical model is developed for estimating the long-term hazard of rare, high impact tropical cyclones events globally. There are three components representing the complete storm lifetime: an environmental index-based genesis model, a beta-advection track model, and an autoregressive intensity model. All three components depend upon the local environmental conditions, including potential intensity, relative sea surface temperature, 850 and 250 hPa steering flow, deep-layer mean vertical shear, 850 hPa vorticity, and midlevel relative humidity. The hazard model, using 400 realizations of a 32 year period (approximately 3,000 storms per realization), captures many aspects of tropical cyclone statistics, such as genesis and track density distribution. Of particular note, it simulates the observed number of rapidly intensifying storms, a challenging issue in tropical cyclone modeling and prediction. Using the return period curve of landfall intensity as a measure of local tropical cyclone hazard, the model reasonably simulates the hazard in the western north Pacific (coastal regions of the Philippines, China, Taiwan, and Japan) and the Caribbean islands. In other regions, the observed return period curve can be captured after a local landfall frequency adjustment that forces the total number of landfalls to be the same as that observed while allowing the model to freely simulate the distribution of intensities at landfall.}

  abstract = {Hierarchical spatial models are very flexible and popular for a vast array of applications in areas such as ecology, social science, public health, and atmospheric science. It is common to carry out Bayesian inference for these models via Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC). Each iteration of the MCMC algorithm is computationally expensive due to costly matrix operations. In addition, the MCMC algorithm needs to be run for more iterations because the strong cross-correlations among the spatial latent variables result in slow mixing Markov chains. To address these computational challenges, we propose a projection-based intrinsic conditional autoregression (PICAR) approach, which is a discretized and dimension-reduced representation of the underlying spatial random field using empirical basis functions on a triangular mesh. Our approach exhibits fast mixing as well as a considerable reduction in computational cost per iteration. PICAR is computationally efficient and scales well to high dimensions. It is also automated and easy to implement for a wide array of user-specified hierarchical spatial models. We show, via simulation studies, that our approach performs well in terms of parameter inference and prediction. We provide several examples to illustrate the applicability of our method, including (i) a parasitic tree infestation data set that showcases its computational efficiency in high-dimensional applications, (ii) a spatially varying coefficient model that demonstrates the ease of implementation of PICAR in the probabilistic programming language stan, and (iii) a watershed survey example that illustrates how PICAR applies to models that are not amenable to efficient inference via existing methods.},

  abstract = {Storm surges are key drivers of coastal flooding, which generate considerable risks. Strategies to manage these risks can hinge on the ability to (i) project the return periods of extreme storm surges and (ii) detect potential changes in their statistical properties. There are several lines of evidence linking rising global average temperatures and increasingly frequent extreme storm surges. This conclusion is, however, subject to considerable structural uncertainty. This leads to two main questions: What are projections under various plausible statistical models? How long would it take to distinguish among these plausible statistical models? We address these questions by analyzing observed and simulated storm surge data. We find that (1) there is a positive correlation between global mean temperature rise and increasing frequencies of extreme storm surges; (2) there is considerable uncertainty underlying the strength of this relationship; and (3) if the frequency of storm surges is increasing, this increase can be detected within a multidecadal timescale ({$\approx$}20 years from now).}

  abstract = {Although terms such as "induced demand" and "latent demand" have been used in transportation planning for several decades, the concept of induced demand has not been precisely defined nor has it been translated into an operational form suitable for modeling. This paper defines "induced" as referring to a movement along a travel demand curve, in which the price dimension includes travel time and other user costs. Selecting the relevant demand curve is then an analytic choice. For FHWA's Highway Economic Requirements System (HERS) model, movement along the within-period, short-run demand curve is referred to as "induced traffic," while movement along the between-period longrun demand curve constitutes a shift in the short-run demand curve and is referred to as induced demand. The model employs this definition to evaluate highway improvement projects using benefit-cost analysis, incorporating effects of short-run traffic volume on changes in the generalized price, as well as effects of long-run land use and other economic feedback. These features were used in the HERS model to prepare the 1997 "Conditions and Performance" report to Congress.}

  abstract = {Over the past 40 years, the discharge in South America's Paran\'a River basin has increased despite no evidence of significant rainfall increases in the basin. In this analysis, we show that the observed multi-decadal increase in discharge can be explained by concomitant changes in land cover that have occurred within the basin during this period. Our analysis also indicates that the peak discharge timing may have shifted concurrently from January/February in the 1970s to March in more recent decades. While land-use effect dominantly alters the long-term temporal dynamics of the river discharge over multi-decades, the change in the seasonality of the discharge can be attributable to the combined effect of the land-use and climate variability. This study suggests that the mean annual discharge is likely to change in the other South American River basins where land transformation is currently taking place, and the shift of the month of peak discharge needs to be taken into consideration to forecast the hydropower generation under changing climate and land conversion.}

  abstract = {Most studies on the impact of climate change on regional water resources focus on long-term average flows or mean water availability, and they rarely take the effects of altered human water use into account. When analyzing extreme events such as floods and droughts, the assessments are typically confined to smaller areas and case studies. At the same time it is acknowledged that climate change may severely alter the risk of hydrological extremes over large regional scales, and that human water use will put additional pressure on future water resources. In an attempt to bridge these various aspects, this paper presents a first-time continental, integrated analysis of possible impacts of global change (here defined as climate and water use change) on future flood and drought frequencies for the selected study area of Europe. The global integrated water model WaterGAP is evaluated regarding its capability to simulate high and low-flow regimes and is then applied to calculate relative changes in flood and drought frequencies. The results indicate large `critical regions' for which significant changes in flood or drought risks are expected under the proposed global change scenarios. The regions most prone to a rise in flood frequencies are northern to northeastern Europe, while southern and southeastern Europe show significant increases in drought frequencies. In the critical regions, events with an intensity of today's 100-year floods and droughts may recur every 10\textendash 50 years by the 2070s. Though interim and preliminary, and despite the inherent uncertainties in the presented approach, the results underpin the importance of developing mitigation and adaptation strategies for global change impacts on a continental scale.}

The model solves simplified equations of mass and momentum, which are driven by storm surge and wave boundary conditions, precipitation rates and upstream river discharges. It includes spatially-varying infiltration and bed roughness terms as well as an absorbing-generating seaward boundary to enable wave-driven flooding. Furthermore, advection and wind stress terms can be included. We demonstrate for the application case of hurricane impact on Jacksonville (Florida, USA) that the observed flooding was a combination of fluvial, pluvial, tidal and wind-driven flooding and that this can be modeled well using the reduced-physics solver. We show that the addition of an advection term to the momentum equations is necessary to model shock flows such as dam breaks but also incident broken waves. Thus, wave-driven flooding can be modeled with high computational efficiency and adequate accuracy as demonstrated for the case of Hernani (the Philippines). The model results show the potential of achieving good accuracy at limited computational expense.}

  abstract = {Generative adversarial networks (GANs) have been recently adopted for super-resolution, an application closely related to what is referred to as ``downscaling'' in the atmospheric sciences: improving the spatial resolution of low-resolution images. The ability of conditional GANs to generate an ensemble of solutions for a given input lends itself naturally to stochastic downscaling, but the stochastic nature of GANs is not usually considered in super-resolution applications. Here, we introduce a recurrent, stochastic super-resolution GAN that can generate ensembles of time-evolving high-resolution atmospheric fields for an input consisting of a low-resolution sequence of images of the same field. We test the GAN using two data sets: one consisting of radar-measured precipitation from Switzerland; the other of cloud optical thickness derived from the Geostationary Earth Observing Satellite 16 (GOES-16). We find that the GAN can generate realistic, temporally consistent super-resolution sequences for both data sets. The statistical properties of the generated ensemble are analyzed using rank statistics, a method adapted from ensemble weather forecasting; these analyses indicate that the GAN produces close to the correct amount of variability in its outputs. As the GAN generator is fully convolutional, it can be applied after training to input images larger than the images used to train it. It is also able to generate time series much longer than the training sequences, as demonstrated by applying the generator to a three-month data set of the precipitation radar data. The source code to our GAN is available at https://github.com/jleinonen/downscaling-rnn-gan.}

  abstract = {The quest for predictions\textemdash and a reliance on the analytical methods that require them\textemdash can prove counter-productive and sometimes dangerous in a fast-changing world.Robust Decision Making (RDM) is a set of concepts, processes, and enabling tools that use computation, not to make better predictions, but to yield better decisions under conditions of deep uncertainty.RDM combines Decision Analysis, Assumption-Based Planning, scenarios, and Exploratory Modeling to stress test strategies over myriad plausible paths into the future, and then to identify policy-relevant scenarios and robust adaptive strategies.RDM embeds analytic tools in a decision support process called ``deliberation with analysis'' that promotes learning and consensus-building among stakeholders.The chapter demonstrates an RDM approach to identifying a robust mix of policy instruments\textemdash carbon taxes and technology subsidies\textemdash for reducing greenhouse gas emissions. The example also highlights RDM's approach to adaptive strategies, agent-based modeling, and complex systems.Frontiers for RDM development include expanding the capabilities of multi-objective RDM (MORDM), more extensive evaluation of the impact and effectiveness of RDM-based decision support systems, and using RDM's ability to reflect multiple world views and ethical frameworks to help improve the way organizations use and communicate analytics for wicked problems.},

Most notably, policy challenges such as abrupt climate change involve potential nonlinear or threshold responses where both the triggering level and subsequent system response are poorly understood. This study uses a simple computer simulation model to compare several alternative frameworks for decision making under uncertainty\textemdash optimal expected utility, the precautionary principle, and three different approaches to robust decision making\textemdash for addressing the challenge of adding pollution to a lake without triggering unwanted and potentially irreversible eutrophication. The three robust decision approaches\textemdash trading some optimal performance for less sensitivity to assumptions, satisficing over a wide range of futures, and keeping options open\textemdash are found to identify similar strategies as the most robust choice. This study also suggests that these robust decision approaches offer a quantitative, decision analytic framework that captures the spirit of the precautionary principle while addressing some of its shortcomings. Finally, this study finds that robust strategies may be preferable to optimum strategies when the uncertainty is sufficiently deep and the set of alternative policy options is sufficiently rich.}

  abstract = {Variability is one of the most salient features of the earth's climate, yet quantitative policy studies have generally ignored the impact of variability on society's best choice of climate-change policy. This omission is troubling because an adaptive emissions-reduction strategy, one that adjusts abatement rates over time based on observations of damages and abatement costs, should perform much better against extreme uncertainty than static, best-estimate policies. However, climate variability can strongly affect the success of adaptive-abatement strategies by masking adverse trends or fooling society into taking too strong an action. This study compares the performance of a wide variety of adaptive greenhouse-gas-abatement strategies against a broad range of plausible future climate-change scenarios. We find that: i) adaptive strategies remain preferable to static, best-estimate policies even with very large levels of climate variability; ii) the most robust strategies are innovation sensitive, that is, adjust future emissions reduction rates on the basis of small changes in observed abatement costs but only for large changes in observed damages; and iii) information about the size of the variability is about a third to an eighth as valuable as information determining the value of the key parameters that represent the long-term, future climate-change state-of-the-world.}

The authors' hypothesis\textemdash as supported by a simple physical argument presented here\textemdash is that this 2CC behavior arises from the physics of convective clouds. To further investigate this, the large-scale atmospheric conditions accompanying summertime afternoon precipitation events are analyzed using surface observations combined with a regional reanalysis. Events are precipitation measurements clustered in time and space. The hourly peak intensities of these events again reveal a 2CC scaling with the surface dewpoint temperature. The temperature excess of moist updrafts initialized at the surface and the maximum cloud depth are clear functions of surface dewpoint, confirming the key role of surface humidity on convective activity. Almost no differences in relative humidity and the dry temperature lapse rate were found across the dewpoint temperature range, supporting the theory that 2CC scaling is mainly due to the response of convection to increases in near-surface humidity, while other atmospheric conditions remain similar. Additionally, hourly precipitation extremes are on average accompanied by substantial large-scale upward motions and therefore large-scale moisture convergence, which appears to accelerate with surface dewpoint. Consequently, most hourly extremes occur in precipitation events with considerable spatial extent. Importantly, this event size appears to increase rapidly at the highest dewpoint temperature range, suggesting potentially strong impacts of climatic warming.}

  abstract = {Decentralised rainwater harvesting (RWH), greywater recycling (GWR), and hybrid rainwater-greywater systems (HRG) mitigate urban water scarcity at both domestic residential dwelling and commercial building scales. However, few studies have been conducted on HRG in mixed urban water provision schemes under tropical climatic conditions. Thus, this study evaluates and compares the environmental and economic impacts of a centralised mains water system (MWS) against a decentralised RWH, GWR and HRG at a domestic and commercial building using life-cycle assessment (LCA) and life-cycle cost (LCC) analysis under tropical climatic conditions. A functional unit (FU) of 1\,m3 of non-potable toilet flushing and irrigation water for a project lifespan of 50 years was used. Results indicate that CML 2001 and TRACI 2.1 methods produce similar results. LCA and LCC indicate that the optimal systems are the commercial HRG and domestic RWH. The commercial HRG has the highest mains water savings (55.3\%), lowest environmental impact scores for seven categories, and is the second fastest system to become financially attractive at USD5.20/m3. Similarly, the domestic RWH has the second highest mains water savings (95.3\%), lowest environmental impact scores relative to a MWS for seven impact categories, and is the first system to become financially attractive at USD2.00/m3. Sensitivity analysis revealed that global warming, water stress index, and eutrophication are most sensitive to a {$\mp$}20\% variation in GW and RW energy intensity values at commercial and domestic buildings, respectively. The financial viability of decentralised RWH, GWR, and HRG systems increase with increasing discount rate and mains water tariff, as well as decreasing electricity tariff and installation factor. Financial incentives and subsidy schemes from the Malaysian government may promote uptake of decentralised water systems for mixed urban water provision, as none of the systems were financially attractive otherwise at a discount rate of 6\% for 50 years.}

This paper reports on the selected findings from the qualitative phase of mixed-methods study that explored nursing students' experience of belongingness while on clinical placements. The 18 interview participants in this study were from Australia and the United Kingdom. They provided a range of perspectives on belongingness and how it influenced their placement experience. Central to this discussion was their strong belief that belonging is a prerequisite for clinical learning. This theme dominated all of the interviews. Given that the primary purpose of clinical placements is for students to learn to nurse, there needs to be a clear understanding of the relationship between belongingness and learning. With reference to the published literature and excerpts from interview transcripts, this paper proposes that reconceptualising nursing students' clinical learning experiences through a `lens of belongingness' provides a new perspective and reveals yet unexplored insights.}

Although current design codes do consider load combinations, these are generally for nonenvironmental (natural hazard) loading and focus on dead and live loads; their combination with each environmental load is considered individually. This paper presents correlations between hurricane winds and wind-induced surge from a flood standpoint to estimate the loss to residential construction from combined wind and surge using assembly-based vulnerability. The method presented for estimating loss from combined wind and surge in hurricanes may be used for design code assessment and calibration, retrofit planning for buildings in coastal areas, disaster-planning purposes, and potentially insurance underwriting.}

  abstract = {Extreme precipitation events damage infrastructure and property; thus, predicting future precipitation patterns in the context of climate change is important. In this study, precipitation projections from 36 downscaled General Circulation Models (GCMs) under two Representative Concentration Pathway (RCP) scenarios (RCP2.6 and RCP8.5) enabled examination of projected changes in future precipitation for the Clear Creek watershed in Houston, Texas, USA. Precipitation from 1950 to 2099 simulated with GCM were downscaled using the Bias-Correction Spatial Disaggregation method. Ten precipitation indices that represent precipitation amount, precipitation intensity, precipitation duration, and precipitation frequency evaluated how precipitation patterns will likely change. Results show that, at the annual scale, mean precipitation will significantly decrease based on RCP8.5, or remain relatively constant based on RCP2.6. Precipitation intensity and precipitation variability, however, will likely increase. Dry periods will lengthen significantly, whereas the length of wet spells will generally remain unchanged. At the monthly scale, the amount of precipitation, precipitation intensity, precipitation frequency and the length of wet spells will likely increase in September. In contrast, precipitation will likely decrease and dry spells will lengthen in April, May, August, November, and December. This finding illustrates that the intra-annual variability in precipitation will increase. The projected changes in precipitation under RCP8.5 are generally greater compared with RCP2.6. Differences between the scenarios are more pronounced towards the end of the century. Houston has recently experienced substantial precipitation variability, including severe drought and record-breaking precipitation from Hurricane Harvey in 2017. These events are consistent with the long-term GCM projections. Findings from this study can be applied to help manage water resources and enhance adaptability to climate change.}

A many-objective optimization (MOO) based design framework and analysis method is developed for achieving four objectives of USDS design. A realistic USDS is adopted for the case study, in which the DTs and LIDs are implemented by this extended MOO-based design method to achieve the optimal result of flooding risk control and water quality improvement. The obtained results are further analyzed for the characteristics of flooding risk control and water quality component evolution in the USDS. The results and analysis demonstrate the effectiveness and applicability of the designed DTs and LIDs to mitigate the flooding risk and improve water quality in USDS.}

  abstract = {In the coming decades, the European energy system is expected to become increasingly reliant on non-dispatchable generation such as wind and solar power. Under such a renewable energy scenario, a better characterization of the extreme weather condition `Dunkelflaute', which can lead to a sustained reduction of wind and solar power, is important. In this paper, we report findings from the very first climatological study of Dunkelflaute events occurring in eleven countries surrounding the North and Baltic Sea areas. By utilizing multi-year meteorological and power production datasets, we have quantified various statistics pertaining to these events and also identified their underlying meteorological drivers. It was found that almost all periods tagged as Dunkelflaute events (with a length of more than 24 h) are in November, December, and January for these countries. On average, there are 50\textendash 100 h of such events happening in each of these three months per year. The limited wind and solar power production during Dunkelflaute events is shown to be mainly driven by large-scale high-pressure systems and extensive low-cloud coverage. Even though the possibility of simultaneous Dunkelflaute events in neighboring countries can be as high as 30\textendash 40\%, such events hardly occur simultaneously in all the eleven countries. Through an interconnected EU-11 power system, the mean frequency of Dunkelflaute drops from 3\textendash 9\% for the individual countries to approximately 3.5\% for the combined region, highlighting the importance of aggregating production over a wide area to better manage the integration of renewable energy generation. \textcopyright{} 2021 by the authors.

The software, which is called VIIRS NOAA GMU Flood Version 1.0 (hereafter referred to as VNG Flood V1.0), consists of a series of algorithms that include water detection, cloud shadow removal, terrain shadow removal, minor flood detection, water fraction retrieval, and floodwater determination. The software is designed for flood detection in any land region between 80\textdegree S and 80\textdegree N, and it has been running routinely with direct broadcast SNPP/VIIRS data at the Space Science and Engineering Center at the University of Wisconsin-Madison (UW/SSEC) and the Geographic Information Network of Alaska at the University of Alaska-Fairbanks (UAF/GINA) since 2014. Near real-time flood maps are distributed via the Unidata Local Data Manager (LDM), reviewed by river forecasters in AWIPS-II (the second generation of the Advanced Weather Interactive Processing System) and applied in flood operations. Initial feedback from operational forecasters on the product accuracy and performance has been largely positive. The software capability has also been extended to areas outside of the USA via a case-driven mode to detect major floods all over the world. Offline evaluation efforts include the visual inspection of over 10,000 VIIRS false-color composite images, an inter-comparison with MODIS automatic flood products and a quantitative validation using Landsat imagery. The steady performance from the 3-year routine process and the promising evaluation results indicate that VNG Flood V1.0 has a high feasibility for flood detection at the product level.}

  abstract = {The classical development of neural networks has primarily focused on learning mappings between finite-dimensional Euclidean spaces. Recently, this has been generalized to neural operators that learn mappings between function spaces. For partial differential equations (PDEs), neural operators directly learn the mapping from any functional parametric dependence to the solution. Thus, they learn an entire family of PDEs, in contrast to classical methods which solve one instance of the equation. In this work, we formulate a new neural operator by parameterizing the integral kernel directly in Fourier space, allowing for an expressive and efficient architecture. We perform experiments on Burgers' equation, Darcy flow, and the Navier-Stokes equation (including the turbulent regime). Our Fourier neural operator shows state-of-the-art performance compared to existing neural network methodologies and it is up to three orders of magnitude faster compared to traditional PDE solvers.}

  abstract = {Detention tank plays an important role in the flooding control in the downstream areas of the urban stormwater drainage system (USDS) during the wet weather seasons. For complex watersheds with specific local flooding control policies, the conventional optimization and design methods are found to be not sufficient for effectively and optimally locating and sizing appropriate detention tanks any more. This paper investigates the optimal design of detention tanks under the constraints of local flooding control criteria, with the aim to develop an efficient and robust method and framework for the design of detention tank network. Coupled with the SWMM-based hydraulic simulation, a modified particle swarm optimizer is adopted to find out non-dominated solutions to minimize both the engineering cost and flooding risks by taking the local design criteria into consideration for the more realistic local engineering application. To validate the proposed method, a real-life case in SA city in China is taken for example to obtain optimal layout and sizes of the detention tank network under different construction factors and design conditions. Different rainfall return periods are also tested to guarantee the robustness of the optimal solutions. The results of this study confirm the feasibility and validity of the proposed methodological framework for multi-objective optimal design of detention tanks in the USDS.}

The task is challenging due to (1) complex spatial dependency on road networks, (2) non-linear temporal dynamics with changing road conditions and (3) inherent difficulty of long-term forecasting. To address these challenges, we propose to model the traffic flow as a diffusion process on a directed graph and introduce Diffusion Convolutional Recurrent Neural Network (DCRNN), a deep learning framework for traffic forecasting that incorporates both spatial and temporal dependency in the traffic flow. Specifically, DCRNN captures the spatial dependency using bidirectional random walks on the graph, and the temporal dependency using the encoder-decoder architecture with scheduled sampling. We evaluate the framework on two real-world large scale road network traffic datasets and observe consistent improvement of 12\% - 15\% over state-of-the-art baselines.}

Through a hydrological modeling approach, we examined how these factors influenced the inflows, peak pool elevations, and outflows of the two most important detention reservoirs in the Houston region, the Addicks and Barker Reservoirs. A high-resolution rainfall reanalysis dataset for extreme storm events, along with a suite of synthetic rainfall values from a variety of storm tracks, were adopted to represent both the truth and the maximum possible rainfall during the Hurricane Harvey period. The results showed the following: Urbanization only led to slight increases in peak inflows, not necessarily to an increase in peak pool elevations, and the ARE contributed to the peak inflow and pool elevation slightly. In contrast, if the cyclone had followed the most adverse track consistent with earlier forecasts (all else being equal), the total volumetric flow into the two reservoirs would have been significantly larger (37\% and 49\% respectively), thus increasing the peak pool elevations by 1.06 and 1.37 m respectively. These results suggest that large uncertainties exist for flood management at a watershed scale during hurricanes, because of the uncertainties in the cyclone track. This would remain true even if storm-relative precipitation rates could be predicted perfectly.}

The results indicate that the CMM5, with its finer resolution (30 km) and more comprehensive physics, simulates the present U.S. climate more accurately than the driving PCM, especially for precipitation, including summer mean patterns, diurnal cycles, and daily frequency distributions. Hence the CMM5 downscaling provides a credible means to improve GCM climate simulations. A parallel CMM5 integration driven by the PCM future (2041\textendash 2050) projection is then analyzed to determine the downscaling impact on regional climate changes. It is shown that the CMM5 generates climate change patterns very different from those predicted by the driving PCM. A key difference is a summer ``warming hole'' over the central United States in the CMM5 relative to the PCM. This study shows that the CMM5 downscaling can significantly reduce GCM biases in simulating the present climate and that this improvement has important consequences for future projections of regional climate changes. For both the present and future climate simulations, the CMM5 results are sensitive to the cumulus parameterization, with strong regional dependence. The deficiency in representing convection is likely the major reason for the PCM's unrealistic simulation of U.S. precipitation patterns and perhaps also for its large warming in the central United States.},

The Sentinel-1 assimilation consistently improved surface soil moisture, whereas root-zone impacts were mostly neutral. Relatively larger improvements were obtained from SMAP assimilation. The joint assimilation of SMAP and Sentinel-1 observations performed best, demonstrating the complementary value of radar and radiometer observations.}

The contribution to the SST from the North Atlantic Oscillation (NAO) over the EMDR was a weak warming, while that from El Ni\~no\textendash Southern Oscillation (ENSO) was negligible. Nevertheless, ENSO, the NAO, and the AMM all contributed to favorable wind shear conditions, while the AMM also produced enhanced atmospheric instability. Compared with the strong hurricane years of 2005/2010, the ocean heat content (OHC) during 2017 was larger across the tropics, with higher SST anomalies over the EMDR and Caribbean Sea. On the other hand, the dynamical/thermodynamical atmospheric conditions, while favorable for enhanced TC activity, were less prominent than in 2005/2010 across the tropics. The results suggest that unusually warm SST in the EMDR together with the long fetch of the resulting storms in the presence of record-breaking OHC may be key factors in driving the strong TC activity in 2017.},

  abstract = {Abstract Numerous statistical and dynamical models have been developed in recent years to forecast ENSO events. However, for most of these models predictability for lead times over 10 months is limited. It has been hypothesized that the tropical Pacific thermocline structure may have critical information to permit longer lead ENSO forecasts. Models that use subsurface sea temperature information have already been known to produce better long lead forecasts. Here, a two-stage statistical ENSO forecasting model is developed and demonstrated using the spatially distributed depth of the 20\textdegree C isotherm (D20) as a proxy for the thermocline. In the first stage, a nonlinear dimension reduction method [maximum variance unfolding (MVU)] is used to decompose the D20 data into canonical modes. The leading spatial patterns as well as lagged values of Ni\~no-3 are then used as predictors in a set of linear regression models to predict the Ni\~no-3 index at lead times of up to 24 months. Cross-validated forecasts using this methodology are shown to have higher skill than those that use a dimension reduction of the same thermocline data using principal component analysis (PCA). The first three modes of the D20 data as revealed by MVU account for 89\% of the variance of the data, as compared to only 48\% of the variance if PCA is used. The spatial patterns of the MVU modes partition the data field in a different way than the PC modes, even though some similarities exist as to the main regions that are active. These patterns and their temporal structure are discussed here, with a view to understanding the possible source of the longer-range predictability of ENSO using the MVU modes. The skill of the PCA- and the MVU-based forecasts of Ni\~no-3 varies depending on the starting month of the forecast for short lead times (5\textendash 10 months). However, for the lead times longer than 1 yr, the MVU-based forecast skill is not seasonally variable, while the PCA-based models do not provide significant skill at these lead times irrespective of the starting month of the forecast. Similar conclusions are obtained for forecast models for the Ni\~no-3.4 and Ni\~no-1.2 indices. The differences between the MVU- and PCA-based models are most marked for the Ni\~no-1.2 long lead forecasts.},

  abstract = {Floods are the main natural disaster in Brazil, causing substantial economic damage and loss of life. Studies suggest that some extreme floods result from a causal climate chain. Exceptional rain and floods are determined by large-scale anomalies and persistent patterns in the atmospheric and oceanic circulations, which influence the magnitude, extent, and duration of these extremes. Moreover, floods can result from different generating mechanisms. These factors contradict the assumptions of homogeneity, and often stationarity, in flood frequency analysis. Here we outline a methodological framework based on clustering using self-organizing maps (SOMs) that allows the linkage of large-scale processes to local-scale observations. The methodology is applied to flood data from several sites in the flood-prone Upper Paran\'a River basin (UPRB) in southern Brazil. The SOM clustering approach is employed to classify the 6-day rainfall field over the UPRB into four categories, which are then used to classify floods into four types based on the spatiotemporal dynamics of the rainfall field prior to the observed flood events. An analysis of the vertically integrated moisture fluxes, vorticity, and high-level atmospheric circulation revealed that these four clusters are related to known tropical and extratropical processes, including the South American low-level jet (SALLJ); extratropical cyclones; and the South Atlantic Convergence Zone (SACZ). Persistent anomalies in the sea surface temperature fields in the Pacific and Atlantic oceans are also found to be associated with these processes. Floods associated with each cluster present different patterns in terms of frequency, magnitude, spatial variability, scaling, and synchronization of events across the sites and subbasins. These insights suggest new directions for flood risk assessment, forecasting, and management.}

  abstract = {Capacity of urban drainage systems (UDSs) can substantially influence flooding properties of urban catchments. This motivates many studies to optimally design UDSs often using multiobjective evolutionary algorithms (MOEAs) as they can explore trade-offs between conflicting objectives (e.g., cost vs. system reliability). However, MOEA-based approaches are typically computationally demanding and their solutions are often practically unacceptable as engineering domain knowledge is often not explicitly considered. To address these two issues, this paper proposes an efficient optimization framework for UDS design, where an engineering-based design method (EBDM) is developed to generate approximate solutions to initialize the MOEA's search, thereby greatly enhancing the optimization efficiency. To improve the solution practicality, two ideas have been implemented in the proposed optimization method (PM): (i) the variability of peak depths across pipes is minimized and (ii) a constraint is introduced to ensure that sizes of pipes in the downstream direction are no smaller than their corresponding upstream diameters. Two real-world UDSs of different size are used to demonstrate the effectiveness of the PM. Results show that (i) the proposed EBDM is effective in producing initial solutions that are very close to the final solutions identified by the optimization methods, (ii) the minimization of the variability of peak depths in pipes is practically meaningful as it can facilitate to identify solutions with great ability in handling future uncertainties (e.g., rainfall variability), and (iii) the PM significantly improves optimization efficiency and solution practicality compared to the traditional optimization approach, with benefits being more prominent for larger UDSs.},

  abstract = {Hurricane storm surge presents a major hazard for the United States. We apply a model-based risk assessment methodology to investigate hurricane storm surge risk for New York City (NYC). We couple a statistical/deterministic hurricane model with the hydrodynamic model SLOSH (sea, lake, and overland surges from hurricanes) to generate a large number of synthetic surge events; the SLOSH model simulations are compared to advanced circulation model simulations. Statistical analysis is carried out on the empirical data. It is observed that the probability distribution of hurricane surge heights at the Battery, NYC, exhibited a heavy tail, which essentially determines the risk of New York City being struck by a catastrophic coastal flood event. The peaks-over-threshold method with the generalized Pareto distribution is applied to estimate the upper tail of the surge heights. The resulting return periods of surge heights are consistent with those of other studies for the New York area. This storm surge risk assessment methodology may be applied to other coastal areas and can be extended to consider the effect of future climate change.}

  abstract = {Water and wastewater infrastructure worldwide faces unprecedented demand and supply conflicts that require unconventional solutions. In this study, we develop a novel modelling framework to assess the environmental and economic implications of a hybrid water supply system that supplements a centralized surface water supply with distributed direct potable reuse (DPR) of municipal wastewater, as a strategy to address such challenges. The model is tested with real water and wastewater systems data from the City of Houston, Texas. Results show that supplementing the conventional centralized water supply with distributed DPR would reduce water age in the drinking-water distribution network and hence improve water quality; properly designed system configurations attain system-wide net energy savings even with the high energy consumption of existing technologies used for advanced treatment of the wastewater. A target energy efficiency for future advanced treatment technologies is identified to achieve net energy saving with all hybrid system configurations. Furthermore, distributed DPR remains financially competitive compared with other unconventional water supply solutions. The modelling framework and associated databases developed in this study serve an important research need for quantitatively characterizing distributed and hybrid water systems, laying the necessary foundation for rational design of integrated urban water systems.},

Watershed characteristics including River basin management in the UK, eco-health watershed management in Canada, sustainable water management in Korea, integrated watershed management in Japan, and healthy watershed management in the US have been examined in this review. Pioneering countries utilize green infrastructural applications to improve their resilience against climate change by adopting adaptive solutions and mitigating pollution sources. This paper includes an overview of the implementation of green infrastructure exemplified by bioretention in urban development and ecosystem maintenance. The good engineering practice for bioretention was established by applying data collected from other research. Biomantle and semi-direct injection of storm water are the two methods for sustaining bioretention functionalities for peak flow reduction and soil stability enhancement. Maximum pollutants reduction efficiencies by bioretention were reported in the past research, including 99\% of phosphorus, 82\% of nitrate, 92\% of heavy metals, and 96\% of suspended solid. Lastly, a conclusive benefit analysis of green infrastructure from environmental, economic, and social perspectives was conducted.}

Few catastrophic hurricanes struck the Western Lake area during two quiescent periods 3400\textendash 5000 and 0\textendash 1000 14C yr B.P. The landfall probabilities increased dramatically to ca. 0.5\% per yr during an ``hyperactive'' period from 1000\textendash 3400 14C yr B.P., especially in the first millennium A.D.

Here we explore the vulnerability of thermoelectric power generation in the United States to climate change by coupling an Earth system model with a thermoelectric power generation model, including state-level representation of environmental regulations on thermal effluents. We find that the impact of climate change is lower than in previous modelling estimates due to an inclusion of a spatially disaggregated representation of environmental regulations and provisional variances that temporarily relieve power plants from permit requirements. More specifically, our results indicate that climate change alone may reduce average generating capacity by 2\textendash 3\% by the 2060s, while reductions of up to 12\% are expected if environmental requirements are enforced without waivers for thermal variation. Our work highlights the significance of accounting for legal constructs and underscores the effects of provisional variances in addition to environmental requirements.},

Of the tested 7 parameterizations, 2 schemes clearly outperformed the others that overpredicted the snowfall amount by as much as \textasciitilde 30\%\textendash 60\% on the basis of snow telemetry observations. Significant differences among these schemes were apparent in domain averages, spatial distributions of hydrometeors, latent heating profiles, and cloud fields.

The second method uses binary linear integer programming to determine the optimal type of stormwater control measures of standardized dimensions to be deployed at selected locations. Both methods minimize the total cost of deploying stormwater control measures, subject to constraints on available budget, volumetric water balance, allowable stormwater volumes, and water-quality characteristics. Two examples illustrate the step-by-step formulation of the linear programming and the binary linear integer programming methods for the optimization of stormwater control measures, and provide solutions to the problems of their optimal sizing and selection. Our results demonstrate the feasibility of meeting stormwater retention and water-quality objectives by the optimal deployment of stormwater control measures as proposed in this work.},

Previous studies aiming to quantify this risk have suggested a wide range of results, from minimal to disastrous capacity loss. In this analysis, we used a power plant modeling tool to study how a variety of power plant configurations respond to varying meteorological conditions. We developed tools that enable the analysis of the climate impacts on power plant operations for a spectrum of geographic situations and technological configurations. We also used these tools to conduct a case study for US coal and natural gas power plants in 2050, under climate change scenario representative concentration pathway 4.5. Our study indicates that rising air temperatures are unlikely to seriously threaten capacity and efficiency at power plants at most locations, provided that wet recirculating and dry cooling systems are designed adequately. Our results allow for simpler modeling of power plant capacity deratings given ambient conditions, highlight potential regions of risk, and underscore the importance of incorporating climate factors into the electric power system's design and planning.}

  abstract = {The extreme variability of rainfall over huge ranges of space\textendash time scales makes direct rain gauge measurements of areal rainfall impossible; assumptions about the rainfall scaling\textemdash whether trivial (homogeneous), or multifractal (heterogeneous)\textemdash are required even for interpolation. The alternative is to use rain surrogates such as radar reflectivities or those based on visible-infra red radiances. In this paper, we argue that cloud radiances should be studied to obtain basic information about the range and type of scaling in the atmosphere. Since, rain and clouds are strongly non-linearly coupled\textemdash and since the scaling of the fields, the scale invariance of the generators/exponents is a symmetry principle\textemdash a break in the scaling in one of the fields would cause a break in the other. Using 909 images from three satellites and six sensors (visible and infra red) collectively spanning the range of scales 5000\textendash 1km, we demonstrate that power law scaling is respected to within an error of {$\pm$}0.3\textendash 0.5\%; that an upper bound on the deviations from the theoretical universal multifractal scaling is 1\textendash 2\% per octave in scale. We also show that the outer scale of the cascade is very close to 20,000km, the largest great circle distance on the earth. Allowing for (one-parameter) subpower law (logarithmic) scaling corrections we show that universal multifractal cascades starting at this scale explain the isotropic moments (order {$\leq$}1.6) to within an error of {$\pm$}0.8\%. We argue that the scaling of these isotropic statistics shows that the diversity of cloud morphologies reflects differences in anisotropies which are effectively washed out by the isotropic statistical methods used. We compare and contrast existing multifractal models showing which can be used as realistic cloud and rain models. We go on to use continuous in scale, anisotropic, space\textendash time multifractal rain and cloud simulations (including radiative transfer) to show how diverse cloud, rain and radiance morphologies can be compatible with the observed isotropic scaling statistics. Finally, we argue that these will be necessary for solving measurement problems including the use of rain gauge, radar and visible/infra red surrogate fields.}

  abstract = {Most people have an intuitive understanding of the weather as referring to the state of the atmosphere at a given time and place and of the climate as a kind of average weather. A popular expression of this dichotomy is ``the climate is what you expect, the weather is what you get'' (Heinlein [1973, p. 352], although often attributed to Mark Twain). Implicit in this belief is the notion of climate as a kind of constant natural state to which the weather would converge if it were averaged over a long enough period. A corollary is that climate change is a consequence of ``climate forcings,'' which are external to the natural climate system and which tend to prevent averages from converging to their true values. In this framework, past climate change may be attributed to orbital changes, variations in solar output, volcanic eruptions, etc. For the recent period, anthropogenic forcings can be added.},

Associated with this widening is a poleward expansion of the subtropical dry zone. Simple scaling analysis supports the notion that the poleward extent of the Hadley cell is set by the location where the thermally driven jet first becomes baroclinically unstable. The expansion of the Hadley cell is caused by an increase in the subtropical static stability, which pushes poleward the baroclinic instability zone and hence the outer boundary of the Hadley cell.},

  abstract = {Optimization algorithms and urban inundation models are powerful tools to identify cost-effective designs of urban green infrastructures such as low-impact developments (LIDs). Most previous LID design optimization studies are based on one-dimensional (1D) inundation models, which cannot provide spatial information of flooding. The LID design optimization on two-dimensional (2D) models or coupled 1D-2D models was rarely explored due to the expensive computing time. This work investigates the effectiveness of surrogate optimization methods for LID design, which have not been used for the LID design problems. We propose a general LID design optimization framework that searches the optimal LID configurations based on both the spatial flood damage under a series of probable flood events and the life cycle costs (LCCs) of LID. We demonstrate the framework using a case study for an urban catchment with 55 sub-catchments and 103 LID decision variables. We tested two different surrogate optimization methods designed for high-dimensional problems: DYnamic COordinate search using Response Surface models (DYCORS) and Trust Region Bayesian Optimization (TuRBO), and one popular non-surrogate method particle swarm (PSO). The result indicates that: (a) DYCORS is a promising method (significantly faster than TuRBO and PSO) for identifying the optimal LID design to minimize the flood damage cost and LID LCC; (b) Optimized LID design could reduce damage cost by as much as \$12.14 million for the urban catchment after eliminating its own LCC compared with no LID implementation; (c) LID is effective in reducing the imperviousness of lands in urban areas.}

  abstract = {Flood hazard mapping in the United States (US) is deeply tied to the National Flood Insurance Program (NFIP). Consequently, publicly available flood maps provide essential information for insurance purposes, but they do not necessarily provide relevant information for non-insurance aspects of flood risk management (FRM) such as public education and emergency planning. Recent calls for flood hazard maps that support a wider variety of FRM tasks highlight the need to deepen our understanding about the factors that make flood maps useful and understandable for local end users. In this study, social scientists and engineers explore opportunities for improving the utility and relevance of flood hazard maps through the co-production of maps responsive to end users' FRM needs. Specifically, two-dimensional flood modeling produced a set of baseline hazard maps for stakeholders of the Tijuana River valley, US, and Los Laureles Canyon in Tijuana, Mexico. Focus groups with natural resource managers, city planners, emergency managers, academia, non-profit, and community leaders refined the baseline hazard maps by triggering additional modeling scenarios and map revisions. Several important end user preferences emerged, such as (1) legends that frame flood intensity both qualitatively and quantitatively, and (2) flood scenario descriptions that report flood magnitude in terms of rainfall, streamflow, and its relation to an historic event. Regarding desired hazard map content, end users' requests revealed general consistency with mapping needs reported in European studies and guidelines published in Australia. However, requested map content that is not commonly produced included (1) standing water depths following the flood, (2) the erosive potential of flowing water, and (3) \emph{pluvial} flood hazards, or flooding caused directly by rainfall. We conclude that the relevance and utility of commonly produced flood hazard maps can be most improved by illustrating pluvial flood hazards and by using concrete reference points to describe flooding scenarios rather than exceedance probabilities or frequencies.}

As onshore and offshore wind energy grows, preferred locations become saturated with numerous wind farms. An upwind wind farm generates `wake effects' (decreases in downwind wind speeds) that undermine a downwind wind farm's power generation and revenues. Here we use a diverse set of analysis tools from the atmospheric science, economic and legal communities to assess costs and consequences of these wake effects, focusing on a West Texas case study. We show that although wake effects vary with atmospheric conditions, they are discernible in monthly power production. In stably stratified atmospheric conditions, wakes can extend 50+\,km downwind, resulting in economic losses of several million dollars over six years for our case study. However, our investigation of the legal literature shows no legal guidance for protecting existing wind farms from such significant impacts.},

  abstract = {The processes that lead to the spatial and temporal evolution of the Bermuda high (BH) during July and August (JA) are investigated on the basis of linear regression analysis. The analysis is based on a Bermuda high index (BHI): the difference in standardized, deseasonalized, and detrended sea level pressure (SLP) between northeast of Bermuda (40\textdegree N, 60\textdegree W) and New Orleans (30\textdegree N, 90\textdegree W). Negative values of BHI indicate a westward expansion of the Bermuda high relative to its climatological-mean location and reduced precipitation in the southeastern United States (SEUS), whereas positive values correspond to BH contraction and enhanced precipitation in the SEUS. Linear regression of the 200-hPa geopotential height based on the BHI reveals the existence of a Rossby wave train that extends zonally from the eastern North Pacific to the eastern North Atlantic. The troughs and ridges associated with this wave train are spatially collocated with the climatological-mean jet stream, indicating that the jet serves as their waveguide. Anomalous troughing in the SEUS associated with this wave train is linked to the contraction of the Bermuda high during JA. The enhanced precipitation is associated with anomalous ascent to the east and south of this trough where anomalous warm advection is observed. Based on these results, it is hypothesized that this Rossby wave train may partially explain the occurrence of suppressed precipitation tied to midsummer drought in the SEUS during July and August. It is found that the BHI has trended from negative to positive in recent decades, suggesting that it may be influenced by low-frequency variability.}

Extra-tropical teleconnections are not always consistent between El Ni\~no events due to stochastic atmospheric variability and diverse sea surface temperature anomalies, making it difficult to quantify teleconnections using only instrumentally-based records. Here we use two paleoclimate data assimilation (DA) products spanning the Last Millennium (LM) to compare changes in amplitudes and frequencies of diverse El Ni\~no events during the pre-industrial period and 20th century, and to assess the stationarity of their North American hydroclimate impacts on multi-decadal to centennial timescales. Using several definitions for Central Pacific (CP) and Eastern Pacific (EP) El Ni\~no, we find a marked increase in 20th century EP El Ni\~no intensity, but no significant changes in CP or EP El Ni\~no frequencies in response to anthropogenic forcing. The associated hydroclimate anomalies indicate (a) dry conditions across the eastern-central and northwestern U.S. during CP El Ni\~no and wetter conditions in the same regions during EP El Ni\~no; (b) wet conditions over the southwestern U.S. for both El Ni\~no types. The magnitude of regional hydroclimate teleconnections also shows large natural variability on multi-decadal to centennial timescales. However, when the entire LM is considered, mean hydroclimate anomalies in North America during CP or EP El Ni\~no are consistent in terms of sign (wet vs. dry). Results are sensitive to proxy data and model priors used in DA products. Inconsistencies between El Ni\~no classification methods underscore the need for improved ENSO diversity classification when assessing precipitation teleconnections.}

We examine California's water history and present several promising solutions to the challenge of urban water security: a combination of conservation and efficiency, desalination, stormwater capture, water reuse, and water banking. These options for urban water, including direct potable reuse, will help dry cities in California and elsewhere achieve more sustainable and diversified water supply portfolios. Pilot and demonstration-scale projects, along with innovations in systems management and new regulations, point the way toward more resilient water supplies for dry cities. Movement toward regional collaboration, implementation of new technologies, and new regulatory regimes are helping to realize a one-water vision. Different cities will develop their own water supply portfolio options appropriate for their geography, values, and urban form on a path toward meeting the urban water challenges of this century.},

  abstract = {Climate change hazards, including increased temperatures, drought, sea level rise, extreme precipitation, wildfires, and changes in freeze\textendash thaw cycles, are expected to degrade drinking water utility system infrastructure and decrease the reliability of water provision. To assess how drinking water utility manager perceptions of these risks affect utility planning, 60 semistructured interviews were conducted with utilities of various sizes, source water supplies, and United States geographical regions. This study analyzes these interviews (1) to evaluate which climate hazards are of primary concern to drinking water managers, (2) to develop a mental model framework for assessing utility-level understanding of climate change risks to system reliability, and (3) to examine the status of current water utility adaptation planning. The results show that concern and awareness of climate hazard risks vary geographically and are grounded in historical exposure; some participants do not believe climate change will influence their system's overall reliability. When considering climate change risks, utility managers tend to focus on effects to water supply and infrastructure, as opposed to changes in operations and maintenance, water quality, or business functions. Most surveyed utilities do not have comprehensive climate adaptation plans despite federal and professional recommendations. The range of beliefs and actions concerning climate adaptation planning indicates that utilities need directed guidance, and policymakers should consider including climate hazards and projections as part of required utility risk and resilience assessments.}

  abstract = {This paper demonstrates the importance of disaggregating population data aggregated by census tracts or other units, for more realistic population distribution/location. A newly developed mapping method, the Cadastral-based Expert Dasymetric System (CEDS), calculates population in hyper-heterogeneous urban areas better than traditional mapping techniques. A case study estimating population potentially impacted by flood hazard in New York City compares the impacted population determined by CEDS with that derived by centroid-containment method and filtered areal-weighting interpolation. Compared to CEDS, 37\% and 72\% fewer people are estimated to be at risk from floods city-wide, using conventional areal weighting of census data, and centroid-containment selection, respectively. Undercounting of impacted population could have serious implications for emergency management and disaster planning. Ethnic/racial populations are also spatially disaggregated to determine any environmental justice impacts with flood risk. Minorities are disproportionately undercounted using traditional methods. Underestimating more vulnerable sub-populations impairs preparedness and relief efforts.}

The deployment of wind and solar power reduces these emissions, but is subject to the variability of the weather. In the present study, we calculate the cost-optimized configuration of variable electrical power generators using weather data with high spatial (13-km) and temporal (60-min) resolution over the contiguous US. Our results show that when using future anticipated costs for wind and solar, carbon dioxide emissions from the US electricity sector can be reduced by up to 80\% relative to 1990 levels, without an increase in the levelized cost of electricity. The reductions are possible with current technologies and without electrical storage. Wind and solar power increase their share of electricity production as the system grows to encompass large-scale weather patterns. This reduction in carbon emissions is achieved by moving away from a regionally divided electricity sector to a national system enabled by high-voltage direct-current transmission.},

  abstract = {Many philosophers and statisticians argue that risk assessors are morally obligated to evaluate the probabilities and consequences of methodological error, and to base their decisions of whether to adopt a given parameter value, model, or hypothesis on those considerations. This argument is couched within the rubric of null hypothesis testing, which I suggest is a poor descriptive and normative model for risk assessment. Risk regulation is not primarily concerned with evaluating the probability of data conditional upon the null hypothesis, but rather with measuring risks, estimating the consequences of available courses of action and inaction, formally characterizing uncertainty, and deciding what to do based upon explicit values and decision criteria. In turn, I defend an ideal of value-neutrality, whereby the core inferential tasks of risk assessment\textemdash such as weighing evidence, estimating parameters, and model selection\textemdash should be guided by the aim of correspondence to reality. This is not to say that value judgments be damned, but rather that they should be accounted for within a structured approach to decision analysis, rather than embedded within risk assessment in an informal manner.},

  abstract = {Retreat from some areas will become unavoidable under intensifying climate change. Existing deployments of managed retreat are at small scale compared to potential future needs, leaving open questions about where, when, and how retreat under climate change will occur. Here, we analyze more than 40,000 voluntary buyouts of flood-prone properties in the United States, in which homeowners sell properties to the government and the land is restored to open space. In contrast to model-based evaluation of potential future retreat, local governments in counties with higher population and income are more likely to administer buyouts. The bought-out properties themselves, however, are concentrated in areas of greater social vulnerability within these counties, pointing to the importance of assessing the equity of buyout implementation and outcomes. These patterns demonstrate the challenges associated with locally driven implementation of managed retreat and the potential benefits of experimentation with different approaches to retreat. Experiences with voluntary buyouts of flood-prone properties provide lessons for managed retreat under climate change.

Today choice under uncertainty is a field in flux: the standard theory is being challenged on several grounds from both within and outside economics.

Behaviors of stakeholders, who might be willing to contribute to improvements and reach a win\textendash win situation, sometimes result in worse conditions for all parties. Game theory can identify and interpret the behaviors of parties to water resource problems and describe how interactions of different parties who give priority to their own objectives, rather than system's objective, result in a system's evolution. Outcomes predicted by game theory often differ from results suggested by optimization methods which assume all parties are willing to act towards the best system-wide outcome. This study reviews applicability of game theory to water resources management and conflict resolution through a series of non-cooperative water resource games. The paper illustrates the dynamic structure of water resource problems and the importance of considering the game's evolution path while studying such problems.}

However, most of the existing projections are based on rising air temperatures alone, ignoring that rising temperatures are associated with increased humidity; a lethal combination that could significantly increase morbidity and mortality rates during extreme heat events. We bridge this gap by identifying the key measures of heat stress, considering both air temperature and near-surface humidity, in characterizing the climate sensitivity of electricity demand at a national scale. Here we show that in many of the high energy consuming states, such as California and Texas, projections based on air temperature alone underestimates cooling demand by as much as 10-15\% under both present and future climate scenarios. Our results establish that air temperature is a necessary but not sufficient variable for adequately characterizing the climate sensitivity of cooling load, and that near-surface humidity plays an equally important role.},

However, there has been limited synthesis between shared problem traits, common EA challenges, and needed advances across major applications. This paper clarifies the current status and future research directions for better solving key water resources problems using EAs. Advances in understanding fitness landscape properties and their effects on algorithm performance are critical. Future EA-based applications to real-world problems require a fundamental shift of focus towards improving problem formulations, understanding general theoretic frameworks for problem decompositions, major advances in EA computational efficiency, and most importantly aiding real decision-making in complex, uncertain application contexts.}

  abstract = {In recent years, wildfires in the western United States have occurred with increasing frequency and scale. Climate change scenarios in California predict prolonged periods of droughts with even greater potential for conditions amenable to wildfires. The Sierra Nevada Mountains provide 70\% of water resources in California, yet how wildfires will impact watershed-scale hydrology is highly uncertain. In this work, we assess the impacts of wildfires perturbations on watershed hydrodynamics using a physically based integrated hydrologic model in a high-performance-computing framework. A representative Californian watershed, the Cosumnes River, is used to demonstrate how postwildfire conditions impact the water and energy balance. Results from the high-resolution model show counterintuitive feedbacks that occur following a wildfire and allow us to identify the regions most sensitive to wildfires conditions, as well as the hydrologic processes that are most affected. For example, whereas evapotranspiration generally decreases in the postfire simulations, some regions experience an increase due to changes in surface water run-off patterns in and near burn scars. Postfire conditions also yield greater winter snowpack and subsequently greater summer run-off as well as groundwater storage in the postfire simulations. Comparisons between dry and wet water years show that climate is the main factor controlling the timing at which some hydrologic processes occur (such as snow accumulation) whereas postwildfire changes to other metrics (such as streamflow) show seasonally dependent impacts primarily due to the timing of snowmelt, illustrative of the integrative nature of hydrologic processes across the Sierra Nevada-Central Valley interface.},

  abstract = {Evaluating a fractal curve's "approximate length" by walking a compass defines a "compass exponent." Long ago, I showed that for a self-similar curve (e.g., a model of coastline), the compass exponent coincides with all the other forms of the fractal dimension, e.g., the similarity, box or mass dimensions. Now walk a compass along a self-affine curve, such as a scalar Brownian record B(t). It will be shown that a full description in terms of fractal dimension is complex. Each version of dimension has a local and a global value, separated by a crossover. First finding: the basic methods of evaluating the global fractal dimension yield 1: globally, a self-affine fractal behaves as it if were not fractal. Second finding: the box and mass dimensions are 1.5, but the compass dimension is D = 2. More generally, for a fractional Bownian record BH(t), (e.g., a model of vertical cuts of relief), the global fractal dimensions are 1, several local fractal dimensions are 2-H, and the compass dimension is 1/H. This 1/H is the fractal dimension of a self-similar fractal trail, whose definition was already implicit in the definition of the record of BH(t).}

  abstract = {Persistent episodes of extreme weather in the Northern Hemisphere summer have been associated with high-amplitude quasi-stationary atmospheric Rossby waves, with zonal wave numbers 6 to 8 resulting from the phenomenon of quasi-resonant amplification (QRA). A fingerprint for the occurrence of QRA can be defined in terms of the zonally averaged surface temperature field. Examining state-of-the-art [Coupled Model Intercomparison Project Phase 5 (CMIP5)] climate model projections, we find that QRA events are likely to increase by \textasciitilde 50\% this century under business-as-usual carbon emissions, but there is considerable variation among climate models. Some predict a near tripling of QRA events by the end of the century, while others predict a potential decrease. Models with amplified Arctic warming yield the most pronounced increase in QRA events. The projections are strongly dependent on assumptions regarding the nature of changes in radiative forcing associated with anthropogenic aerosols over the next century. One implication of our findings is that a reduction in midlatitude aerosol loading could actually lead to Arctic de-amplification this century, ameliorating potential increases in persistent extreme weather events. Projections of warming favor more frequent extreme weather events, but there is a large spread due to aerosol forcing changes.

  abstract = {In cases, which are characterized by deep uncertainty it is appropriate to develop dynamic and adaptable plans. This paper presents an approach that uses multi-objective genetic algorithms to automate the development of dynamic adaptation pathways for stormwater management for a tropical urban catchment located in Singapore. Pathways spanning a range of climate and landuse scenarios are developed. Three objectives, namely the economic value of flexibility or the real options value, the traditional net present value and flood robustness are balanced to develop the pareto optimal pathways. Given that the pathways are developed under a blanket of uncertainty it is certain that results will have to be re-computed at different time steps in the future. The assessment performed in this manner offers the ability to recompute results easily when adaptation becomes necessary. Comparison of the results obtained for the different landuse scenarios show that if done right, landuse planning can serve as a solution rather than a problem to cater to a changing climate. This notion coupled with the individual adaptation pathways enables the development of an adaptation strategy that helps outline short and long-term policies necessary to cater to an uncertain future.}

  abstract = {The United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change agreed to ``strengthen the global response to the threat of climate change, in the context of sustainable development and efforts to eradicate poverty'' (UNFCCC 2015). Designing a global mitigation strategy to support this goal poses formidable challenges. For one, there are trade-offs between the economic costs and the environmental benefits of averting climate impacts. Furthermore, the coupled human-Earth systems are subject to deep and dynamic uncertainties. Previous economic analyses typically addressed either the former, introducing multiple objectives, or the latter, making mitigation actions responsive to new information. This paper aims at bridging these two separate strands of literature. We demonstrate how information feedback from observed global temperature changes can jointly improve the economic and environmental performance of mitigation strategies. We focus on strategies that maximize discounted expected utility while also minimizing warming above 2 \textdegree C, damage costs, and mitigation costs. Expanding on the Dynamic Integrated Climate-Economy (DICE) model and previous multi-objective efforts, we implement closed-loop control strategies, map the emerging trade-offs and quantify the value of the temperature information feedback under both well-characterized and deep climate uncertainties. Adaptive strategies strongly reduce high regrets, guarding against mitigation overspending for less sensitive climate futures, and excessive warming for more sensitive ones.}

This paper integrates perspectives from meteorologists, climatologists, statisticians, and hydrologists to identify generic end user (in particular, impact modeler) needs and to discuss downscaling capabilities and gaps. End users need a reliable representation of precipitation intensities and temporal and spatial variability, as well as physical consistency, independent of region and season. In addition to presenting dynamical downscaling, we review perfect prognosis statistical downscaling, model output statistics, and weather generators, focusing on recent developments to improve the representation of space-time variability. Furthermore, evaluation techniques to assess downscaling skill are presented. Downscaling adds considerable value to projections from global climate models. Remaining gaps are uncertainties arising from sparse data; representation of extreme summer precipitation, subdaily precipitation, and full precipitation fields on fine scales; capturing changes in small-scale processes and their feedback on large scales; and errors inherited from the driving global climate model.},

In many cases this burden becomes overwhelming.This has motivated a move away from exact methods (often because exact answers cannot be calculated) and towards more approximate methods. The principle is that it is better to obtain a rough answer than to seek an exact answer that cannot be computed in a reasonable time.There will be a continuing trend to move away from exact methods and towards approximate methods as the quantity and complexity of data continue to grow.Unfortunately, there is no 'one-size-fits-all' computational analysis method. We discuss a range of methods, but the performance of each will vary from problem to problem.}

However, climate and non-climate challenges facing infrastructure are not purely technological. Ecological and social systems also warrant consideration to manage issues of overconfidence, inflexibility, interdependence, and resource utilization - among others. As a result, techno-centric adaptation strategies can result in unwanted tradeoffs, unintended consequences, and under-addressed vulnerabilities. Techno-centric strategies that ``lock-in'' today's infrastructure systems to vulnerable future design, management, and regulatory practices may be particularly problematic by exacerbating these ecological and social issues rather than ameliorating them. Given these challenges, we develop a conceptual model and infrastructure adaptation case studies to argue the following: 1) infrastructure systems are not simply technological, and should be understood as complex and interconnected social, ecological, and technological systems (SETS); 2) infrastructure challenges, like lock-in, stem from SETS interactions that are often overlooked and underappreciated; 3) framing infrastructure with a ``SETS lens'' can help identify and prevent maladaptive issues like lock-in; and 4) a SETS lens can also highlight effective infrastructure adaptation strategies that may not traditionally be considered. Ultimately, we find that treating infrastructure as SETS shows promise for increasing the adaptive capacity of infrastructure systems by highlighting how lock-in and vulnerabilities evolve, and how multidisciplinary strategies can be deployed to address these challenges by broadening the options for adaptation.},

Furthermore, we characterize this variability over the widest possible range of scales that the available information allows, and we try to connect the deterministic Milankovitch cycles with the Hurst\textendash Kolmogorov (HK) stochastic dynamics. To this aim, we analyse two instrumental series of global temperature and eight proxy series with varying lengths from 2 thousand to 500 million years. In our analysis, we use a simple tool, the climacogram, which is the logarithmic plot of standard deviation versus time scale, and its slope can be used to identify the presence of HK dynamics. By superimposing the climacograms of the different series, we obtain an impressive overview of the variability for time scales spanning almost nine orders of magnitude\textemdash from 1 month to 50 million years. An overall climacogram slope of -0.08 supports the presence of HK dynamics with Hurst coefficient of at least 0.92. The orbital forcing (Milankovitch cycles) is also evident in the combined climacogram at time scales between 10 and 100 thousand years. While orbital forcing favours predictability at the scales it acts, the overview of climate variability at all scales suggests a big picture of irregular change and uncertainty of Earth's climate.}

  abstract = {Abstract Weather radars and gauge observations are the primary observations to determine the coverage and magnitude of precipitation; however, radar and gauge networks have significant coverage gaps, which can underrepresent or even miss the occurrence of precipitation. This is especially noticeable in mountainous regions and in shallow precipitation regimes. The following study presents a methodology to improve spatial representations of precipitation by seamlessly blending multiple precipitation sources within the Multi-Radar Multi-Sensor (MRMS) system. A high spatiotemporal resolution multisensor merged quantitative precipitation estimation (QPE) product (MSQPE) is generated by using gauge-corrected radar QPE as a primary precipitation source with a combination of hourly gauge observations, monthly precipitation climatologies, numerical weather prediction short-term precipitation forecasts, and satellite observations to use in areas of insufficient radar coverage. The merging of the precipitation sources is dependent upon radar coverage based on an updated MRMS radar quality index, surface and atmospheric conditions, topography, gauge locations, and precipitation values. Evaluations of the MSQPE product over the western United States resulted in improved statistical measures over its individual input precipitation sources, particularly the locally gauge-corrected radar QPE. The MSQPE scheme demonstrated its ability to sufficiently fill in areas where radar alone failed to detect precipitation due to significant beam blockage or poor coverage while minimizing the generation of false precipitation and underestimation biases that resulted from radar overshooting precipitation.},

  abstract = {The three-parameter generalized extreme-value (GEV) distribution has found wide application for describing annual floods, rainfall, wind speeds, wave heights, snow depths, and other maxima. Previous studies show that small-sample maximum-likelihood estimators (MLE) of parameters are unstable and recommend L moment estimators. More recent research shows that method of moments quantile estimators have for -0.25 {$<$} {$\kappa$} {$<$} 0.30 smaller root-mean-square error than L moments and MLEs. Examination of the behavior of MLEs in small samples demonstrates that absurd values of the GEV-shape parameter {$\kappa$} can be generated. Use of a Bayesian prior distribution to restrict {$\kappa$} values to a statistically/physically reasonable range in a generalized maximum likelihood (GML) analysis eliminates this problem. In our examples the GML estimator did substantially better than moment and L moment quantile estimators for - 0.4 {$\leq$} {$\kappa$} {$\leq$} 0.}

  abstract = {This paper considers use of historical information with partial duration series (PDS) and annual maximum series (AMS) flood risk models. A generalized Pareto distribution for exceedances over a threshold combined with the Poisson arrival model yields a three-parameter generalized extreme value (GEV) distribution for the AMS. When fitting three-parameter GEV models using generalized maximum likelihood estimators, the average gains from use of historical information are about the same with both AMS and PDS frameworks, though the exact values depend upon the shape parameter \cyrchar\cyrk. The effect of the arrival rate {$\lambda$} is modest. In general, average gains are higher when \cyrchar\cyrk{} = 0.0 as opposed to when -0.3 {$\leq$} \cyrchar\cyrk{} {$\leq$} -0.1. When fitting two-parameter models (exponential\textemdash Poisson and Gumbel), the average gains are less than those observed with the corresponding three-parameter models with \cyrchar\cyrk{} = 0. Fitting a two-parameter AMS lognormal distribution to lognormal data yielded higher average gains with use of historical information than were obtained with the two-parameter AMS/Gumbel distribution.},

  abstract = {There is an increasing interest in the relation between the solar activity and climate change. As for the solar activity, a fractal property of the sunspot number was studied by many works. In general, a fractal property was observed in the time series of dynamics of complex systems. The purposes of this study are to investigate the relations among the solar activity, total ozone, Quasi-Biennial Oscillation (QBO), the North Atlantic Oscillation (NAO), and El Ni?o-Southern Oscillation (ENSO) from a view of multi-fractality. To detect the changes of multifractality, we examined the multifractal analysis on the time series of the solar 10.7-cm radio flux (F10.7 flux), total ozone, QBO, NAO, and Ni?o3.4 indices. During the period 1950 and 2010, for the F10.7 flux and QBO index, the matching in monofractality or multifractality is observed and the increase and decrease of multifractality is similar; that is the change of multifractality is similar. In the same way, it is very similar, during the period 1985 and 2010, for the QBO and the total ozone, and during the period 1950 and 2010, for the QBO, and NAO and for the QBO, and Ni?o3.4. Compared to Ni?o3.4, the multifractality of NAO and QBO was strong and it turns out that they are undergoing unstable change. The relation among the solar activity, total ozone, QBO, NAO, and ENSO was clarified by the methods of fractal analysis and the wavelet coherence. These findings will contribute to the research of the relation between the solar activity and climate change.},

First, we discuss the transforming of a time series from such systems to a complex network. The natural approach is to calculate the recurrence matrix and interpret such as the adjacency matrix of an associated complex network, called recurrence network. Using complex network measures, such as transitivity coefficient, we demonstrate that this approach is very efficient for identifying qualitative transitions in observational data, e.g., when analyzing paleoclimate regime transitions. Second, we demonstrate the use of directed spatial networks constructed from spatio-temporal measurements of such systems that can be derived from the synchronized-in-time occurrence of extreme events in different spatial regions. Although there are many possibilities to investigate such spatial networks, we present here the new measure of network divergence and how it can be used to develop a prediction scheme of extreme rainfall events.}

  abstract = {Statistical models provide an alternative approach to using dynamical models in seasonal climate forecasting. In statistical models relationships between one set of data, the predictors, and a second set, the predictands, are sought. Common predictands include seasonal mean temperatures and accumulated precipitation, and are typically predicted using antecedent sea surface temperatures primarily within the tropical oceans. Predictions are made on the assumption that historically observed relationships are expected to apply in the future. There are many conditions for such an assumption to be valid, including the need for high-quality datasets to ensure that the historical relationships are robustly measured, and the need for relationships to have a sound theoretical basis. Because of the possibility of identifying spurious relationships between the predictors and the predictands, the statistical model should be tested carefully on independent data. Most statistical models are based on linear regression, which provides a ``best guess'' forecast under the assumption that a given change in the value of a predictor results in a constant change in the expected value of the predictand regardless of the value of the predictor. Modifications to the linear model can be made or alternative statistical procedures used when there is good reason to expect a relationship to be nonlinear. However, other weaknesses of linear regression may also require these alternatives to be considered seriously. The primary problems with linear regression are multiplicity, multicolinearity, and non-normality of the predictands. Multiplicity refers to the effects of having a large number of candidate predictors: the danger of finding a spurious relationship increases. Multicolinearity arises when more than one predictor is used in the model and there are strong relationships between the predictors which can result in large errors in calculating the parameters of the model. Finally, a linear regression model may not be adequately constructed if the data being predicted have a strongly skewed or otherwise non-Gaussian distribution; seasonally accumulated precipitation often exhibits such problems. Alternative forms of linear and non-linear statistical models can be applied to address such distributional problems.},

The sampled network included 12 municipal and 7 private landfills with varying landfill waste compositions, geographic and climatic settings, ages of waste, waste loads, and leachate production. A total of 129 out of 202 CECs were detected during this study, including 62 prescription pharmaceuticals, 23 industrial chemicals, 18 nonprescription pharmaceuticals, 16 household chemicals, 6 steroid hormones, and 4 plant/animal sterols. CECs were detected in every leachate sample, with the total number of detected CECs in samples ranging from 6 to 82 (median = 31). Bisphenol A (BPA), cotinine, and N,N-diethyltoluamide (DEET) were the most frequently detected CECs, being found in 95\% of the leachate samples, followed by lidocaine (89\%) and camphor (84\%). Other frequently detected CECs included benzophenone, naphthalene, and amphetamine, each detected in 79\% of the leachate samples. CEC concentrations spanned six orders of magnitude, ranging from ng L-1 to mg L-1. Industrial and household chemicals were measured in the greatest concentrations, composing more than 82\% of the total measured CEC concentrations. Maximum concentrations for three household and industrial chemicals, para-cresol (7 020 000 ng L-1), BPA (6 380 000 ng L-1), and phenol (1 550 000 ng L-1), were the largest measured, with these CECs composing 70\% of the total measured CEC concentrations. Nonprescription pharmaceuticals represented 12\%, plant/animal sterols 4\%, prescription pharmaceuticals 1\%, and steroid hormones {$<$}1\% of the total measured CEC concentrations. Leachate from landfills in areas receiving greater amounts of precipitation had greater frequencies of CEC detections and concentrations in leachate than landfills receiving less precipitation.}

However, most applications have focused on causal discovery, i.e. inferring the causal relationships and causal structure from data. This paper instead examines causality through the lens of causal inference and how expert-defined causal graphs, a fundamental from causal theory, can be used to clarify assumptions, identify tractable problems, and aid interpretation of results and their causality in Earth science research. We apply causal theory to generic graphs of the Earth system to identify where causal inference may be most tractable and useful to address problems in Earth Science, and avoid potentially incorrect conclusions. Specifically, causal inference may be useful when: (1) the effect of interest is only causally affected by the observed portion of the state space; or: (2) the cause of interest can be assumed to be independent of the evolution of the system's state; or: (3) the state space of the system is reconstructable from lagged observations of the system. However, we also highlight through examples how causal graphs can be used to explicitly define and communicate assumptions and hypotheses, and help to structure analyses, even if causal inference is ultimately challenging given the data availability, limitations and uncertainties.},

  abstract = {Increasing vapor pressure deficit (VPD) increases atmospheric demand for water. While increased evapotranspiration (ET) in response to increased atmospheric demand seems intuitive, plants are capable of reducing ET in response to increased VPD by closing their stomata. We examine which effect dominates the response to increasing VPD: atmospheric demand and increases in ET or plant response (stomata closure) and decreases in ET. We use Penman-Monteith, combined with semiempirical optimal stomatal regulation theory and underlying water use efficiency, to develop a theoretical framework for assessing ET response to VPD. The theory suggests that depending on the environment and plant characteristics, ET response to increasing VPD can vary from strongly decreasing to increasing, highlighting the diversity of plant water regulation strategies. The ET response varies due to (1) climate, with tropical and temperate climates more likely to exhibit a positive ET response to increasing VPD than boreal and arctic climates; (2) photosynthesis strategy, with C3 plants more likely to exhibit a positive ET response than C4 plants; and (3) plant type, with crops more likely to exhibit a positive ET response, and shrubs and gymniosperm trees more likely to exhibit a negative ET response. These results, derived from previous literature connecting plant parameters to plant and climate characteristics, highlight the utility of our simplified framework for understanding complex land-atmosphere systems in terms of idealized scenarios in which ET responds to VPD only. This response is otherwise challenging to assess in an environment where many processes coevolve together.},

We use a subset of historical model simulations and future model projections (RCP8.5) from the Coupled Model Intercomparison Project phase 5 (CMIP5). We evaluate the representation of five precipitation summary metrics in the historical simulations using observations from the NASA Tropical Rainfall Measuring Mission (TRMM) satellites. The summary metrics include mean, annual and interannual variability, and maximum and minimum extremes of precipitation. The estimated model average produced with BMA is shown to have higher accuracy in simulating mean rainfall than the ensemble mean (RMSE of 0.49 for BMA versus 0.65 for ensemble mean), and a more constrained spread of uncertainty with roughly a third of the total uncertainty than is produced with the multimodel ensemble. The results show that, by the end of the century, the mean daily rainfall is projected to increase for most of the East Coast and the Northwest, may decrease in the southern United States, and with little change expected for the Southwest. For extremes, the wettest year on record is projected to become wetter for the majority of CONUS and the driest year to become drier. We show that BMA offers a framework to more accurately estimate and to constrain the spread of uncertainties of future climate, such as precipitation changes over CONUS.},

Algorithms that enable an automatic delineation of flooded areas are an essential component of any SAR-based monitoring service but are to date quasi non-existent. Here we propose a hybrid methodology, which combines radiometric thresholding and region growing as an approach enabling the automatic, objective and reliable flood extent extraction from SAR images. The method relies on the calibration of a statistical distribution of `open water' backscatter values inferred from SAR images of floods. A radiometric thresholding provides the seed region for a subsequent region growing process. Change detection is included as an additional step that limits over-detection of inundated areas. Two variants of the proposed flood extraction algorithm (with and without integration of reference images) are tested against four state-of-the-art benchmark methods. The methods are evaluated through two case studies: the July 2007 flood of the Severn river (UK) and the February 1997 flood of the Red river (US). Our trial cases show that considering a reference pre- or post-flood image gives the same performance as optimized manual approaches. This encouraging result indicates that the proposed method may indeed outperform all manual approaches if no training data are available and the parameters associated with these methods are determined in a non-optimal way. The results further demonstrate the algorithm's potential for accurately processing data from different SAR sensors.}

  abstract = {Contrary to `static' pathways that are defined once for all, this article deals with the need for policy makers to adopt a dynamic adaptive policy pathway for managing decarbonization over the period of implementation. When choosing a pathway as the most desirable option, it is important to keep in mind that each decarbonization option relies on the implementation of specific policies and instruments. Given structural, effectiveness, and timing uncertainties specific to each policy option, they may fail in delivering the expected outcomes in time. The possibility of diverging from an initial decarbonization trajectory to another one without incurring excessive costs should therefore be a strategic element in the design of an appropriate decarbonization strategy. The article relies on initial experiences in France and Germany on decarbonization planning and implementation to define elements for managing dynamic adjustment issues. Such an adaptive pathway strategy should combine long-lived incentives, like a pre-announced escalating carbon price, to form consistent expectations, as well as adaptive policies to improve overall robustness and resilience. We sketch key elements of a monitoring process based on an ex ante definition of leading indicators that should be assessed regularly and combined with signposts and trigger values at the subsector level.Policy relevanceThese research questions are of special interest and urgency following the Paris Agreement in 2015. It calls on all countries to monitor the implementation of their national contributions and review their ambition regularly. The regular revision of decarbonization pathways constitute a great research opportunity to gather experiences on decarbonization pathway implementation and on dynamic management issues to progress towards an operational dynamic adaptive policy pathway mechanism.}

  abstract = {Interactive River-Aquifer Simulation-2010 (IRAS-2010) is a generalized water resource system simulation model. IRAS-2010 is a new release of IRAS previously released by Cornell University in 1995. Given hydrological inflows, evaporation rates, water allocation rules, reservoir release rules, consumptive water demands and minimum environmental flows, IRAS-2010 estimates flows, surface water and groundwater storage, water use, energy use, and operating costs throughout the water resource network at each user-defined time-step. Multi-reservoir release rule curves, streamflow routing, regional groundwater flow, ecological flows, hydropower, pumping, desalination, and other features can be represented. The IRAS-2010 model is linked to a generic user-interface called HydroPlatform; both model and user-interface are open-source. We present an IRAS-2010 model of London's conjunctive use water resource system that satisfactorily emulates a more sophisticated model currently used by regulators. Results from daily and weekly time-step models are compared. IRAS-2010's fast run times make it appropriate for workshop settings and advanced planning methods that require many model evaluations. Model limitations, benefits, project organization and future plans are outlined.}

  abstract = {Summary Stationarity assumptions of linked human\textendash water systems are frequently invalid given the difficult-to-predict changes affecting such systems. In this case water planning occurs under conditions of deep or severe uncertainty, where the statistical distributions of future conditions and events are poorly known. In such situations predictive system simulation models are typically run under different scenarios to evaluate the performance of future plans under different conditions. Given that there are many possible plans and many possible futures, which simulations will lead to the best designs? Robust Decision Making (RDM) and Info-Gap Decision Theory (IGDT) provide a structured approach to planning complex systems under such uncertainty. Both RDM and IGDT make repeated use of trusted simulation models to evaluate different plans under different future conditions. Both methods seek to identify robust rather than optimal decisions, where a robust decision works satisfactorily over a broad range of possible futures. IGDT efficiently charts system performance with robustness and opportuneness plots summarising system performance for different plans under the most dire and favourable sets of future conditions. RDM samples a wider range of dire, benign and opportune futures and offers a holistic assessment of the performance of different options. RDM also identifies through `scenario discovery' which combinations of uncertain future stresses lead to system vulnerabilities. In our study we apply both frameworks to a water resource system planning problem: London's water supply system expansion in the Thames basin, UK. The methods help identify which out of 20 proposed water supply infrastructure portfolios is the most robust given severely uncertain future hydrological inflows, water demands and energy prices. Multiple criteria of system performance are considered: service reliability, storage susceptibility, capital and operating cost, energy use and environmental flows. Initially the two decision frameworks lead to different recommendations. We show the methods are complementary and can be beneficially used together to better understand results and reveal how the particulars of each method can skew results towards particular future plans.}

  abstract = {When developing computational models to analyze the tradeoffs between climate risk management strategies (i.e., mitigation, adaptation, or geoengineering), scientists make explicit and implicit decisions that are influenced by their beliefs, values and preferences. Model descriptions typically include only the explicit decisions and are silent on value judgments that may explain these decisions. Eliciting scientists' mental models, a systematic approach to determining how they think about climate risk management, can help to gain a clearer understanding of their modeling decisions. In order to identify and represent the role of values, beliefs and preferences on decisions, we used an augmented mental models research approach, namely values-informed mental models (ViMM). We conducted and qualitatively analyzed interviews with eleven climate risk management scientists. Our results suggest that these scientists use a similar decision framework to each other to think about modeling climate risk management tradeoffs, including eight specific decisions ranging from defining the model objectives to evaluating the model's results. The influence of values on these decisions varied between our scientists and between the specific decisions. For instance, scientists invoked ethical values (e.g., concerns about human welfare) when defining objectives, but epistemic values (e.g., concerns about model consistency) were more influential when evaluating model results. ViMM can (i) enable insights that can inform the design of new computational models and (ii) make value judgments explicit and more inclusive of relevant values. This transparency can help model users to better discern the relevance of model results to their own decision framing and concerns.}

We define robustness as trading a small decrease in a strategy's expected performance for a significant increase in a strategy's performance in the worst cases. Specifically, we modify the Dynamic Integrated model of Climate and the Economy (DICE-07) to include a simple representation of a climate threshold response, parametric uncertainty, structural uncertainty, learning, and different decision-making criteria. Economic analyses of climate change strategies typically adopt the expected utility maximization (EUM) framework. We compare EUM with two decision criteria adopted from the finance literature, namely Limited Degree of Confidence (LDC) and Safety First (SF). Both criteria increase the relative weight of the performance under the worst-case scenarios compared to EUM. We show that the LDC and SF criteria provide a computationally feasible foundation for identifying greenhouse gas mitigation strategies that may prove more robust than those identified by the EUM criterion. More robust strategies show higher near-term investments in emissions abatement. Reducing uncertainty has a higher economic value of information for the LDC and SF decision criteria than for EUM.}

Extreme weather events are projected to increase further with the advance of human-driven climate change. Both recent and historical experiences indicate that infectious disease outbreaks very often follow extreme weather events, as microbes, vectors and reservoir animal hosts exploit the disrupted social and environmental conditions of extreme weather events. This review article examines infectious disease risks associated with extreme weather events; it draws on recent experiences including Hurricane Katrina in 2005 and the 2010 Pakistan mega-floods, and historical examples from previous centuries of epidemics and `pestilence' associated with extreme weather disasters and climatic changes. A fuller understanding of climatic change, the precursors and triggers of extreme weather events and health consequences is needed in order to anticipate and respond to the infectious disease risks associated with human-driven climate change. Post-event risks to human health can be constrained, nonetheless, by reducing background rates of persistent infection, preparatory action such as coordinated disease surveillance and vaccination coverage, and strengthened disaster response. In the face of changing climate and weather conditions, it is critically important to think in ecological terms about the determinants of health, disease and death in human populations.},

  abstract = {Abstract Robustness is being used increasingly for decision analysis in relation to deep uncertainty and many metrics have been proposed for its quantification. Recent studies have shown that the application of different robustness metrics can result in different rankings of decision alternatives, but there has been little discussion of what potential causes for this might be. To shed some light on this issue, we present a unifying framework for the calculation of robustness metrics, which assists with understanding how robustness metrics work, when they should be used, and why they sometimes disagree. The framework categorizes the suitability of metrics to a decision-maker based on (1) the decision-context (i.e., the suitability of using absolute performance or regret), (2) the decision-maker's preferred level of risk aversion, and (3) the decision-maker's preference toward maximizing performance, minimizing variance, or some higher-order moment. This article also introduces a conceptual framework describing when relative robustness values of decision alternatives obtained using different metrics are likely to agree and disagree. This is used as a measure of how ?stable? the ranking of decision alternatives is when determined using different robustness metrics. The framework is tested on three case studies, including water supply augmentation in Adelaide, Australia, the operation of a multipurpose regulated lake in Italy, and flood protection for a hypothetical river based on a reach of the river Rhine in the Netherlands. The proposed conceptual framework is confirmed by the case study results, providing insight into the reasons for disagreements between rankings obtained using different robustness metrics.}

An increase in the number of floods affecting basements in the area has indicated the need for improvements to the system. The cost of such improvements could be very high, and as such it is important to determine whether the traditional approach of applying 30-year spatially uniform design storms results in substantial overestimation. The first step in this is to generate simulations of spatially distributed rainfall events, from which 30-year storms can be extracted. Storms are modelled as clusters of Gaussian rainfall cells, extending the earlier Willems method to radar rainfall data. The parameters describing the cells and their motion are sampled from probability distributions derived from parameter estimates gained from 45 historical storm events within the catchment for the period 2000\textendash 2011. This spatial-temporal stochastic rainfall generator produces a two-dimensional time series of simulated storm events, from which events of given return period can be identified.}

We recommend dropping the NHST paradigm--and the p-value thresholds intrinsic to it--as the default statistical paradigm for research, publication, and discovery in the biomedical and social sciences. Specifically, we propose that the p-value be demoted from its threshold screening role and instead, treated continuously, be considered along with currently neglected factors (e.g., prior and related evidence, plausibility of mechanism, study design and data quality, real world costs and benefits, novelty of finding, and other factors that vary by research domain) as just one among many pieces of evidence. We have no desire to "ban" p-values or other purely statistical measures. Rather, we believe that such measures should not be thresholded and that, thresholded or not, they should not take priority over the neglected factors. Instead, we offer recommendations for how our proposal can be implemented in the scientific publication process as well as in statistical decision making more broadly.},

In hyperlinked environments, such as the Web, where users navigate via clicks, central content receives high traffic, becoming target for advertising campaigns. While there is an extensive amount of work on centrality measures and their efficient computation, controlling nodes' centrality via network updates is a more recent and challenging task. Performing minimal modifications to a network to achieve a desired property falls under the umbrella of network design problems. This paper is focused on improving group (coverage and betweenness) centrality, which is a function of the shortest paths passing through a set of nodes, by adding edges to the network. Several variations of the problem, which are NP-hard as well as APX-hard, are introduced. We present a greedy algorithm, and even faster sampling algorithms, for group centrality maximization with theoretical quality guarantees under realistic constraints. The experimental results show that our sampling algorithms outperform the best baseline solution in terms of centrality by up to 5 times while being 2\textendash 3 orders of magnitude faster than our greedy approach.}

  abstract = {K-cores are maximal induced subgraphs where all vertices have degree at least k. These dense patterns have applications in community detection, network visualization and protein function prediction. However, k-cores can be quite unstable to network modifications, which motivates the question: How resilient is the k-core structure of a network, such as the Web or Facebook, to edge deletions? We investigate this question from an algorithmic perspective. More specifically, we study the problem of computing a small set of edges for which the removal minimizes the \$k\$-core structure of a network. This paper provides a comprehensive characterization of the hardness of the k-core minimization problem (KCM), including innaproximability and fixed-parameter intractability. Motivated by such a challenge in terms of algorithm design, we propose a novel algorithm inspired by Shapley value -- a cooperative game-theoretic concept -- that is able to leverage the strong interdependencies in the effects of edge removals in the search space. As computing Shapley values is also NP-hard, we efficiently approximate them using a randomized algorithm with probabilistic guarantees. Our experiments, using several real datasets, show that the proposed algorithm outperforms competing solutions in terms of k-core minimization while being able to handle large graphs. Moreover, we illustrate how KCM can be applied in the analysis of the k-core resilience of networks.},

  abstract = {ABSTRACT The Coupled Model Intercomparison Project (CMIP) was established to study and intercompare climate simulations made with coupled ocean\textendash atmosphere\textendash cryosphere\textendash land GCMs. There are two main phases (CMIP1 and CMIP2), which study, respectively, 1) the ability of models to simulate current climate, and 2) model simulations of climate change due to an idealized change in forcing (a 1\% per year CO{$_2$} increase). Results from a number of CMIP projects were reported at the first CMIP Workshop held in Melbourne, Australia, in October 1998. Some recent advances in global coupled modeling related to CMIP were also reported. Presentations were based on preliminary unpublished results. Key outcomes from the workshop were that 1) many observed aspects of climate variability are simulated in global coupled models including the North Atlantic oscillation and its linkages to North Atlantic SSTs, El Ni\~no\textendash like events, and monsoon interannual variability; 2) the amplitude of both high- and low-frequency global mean surface temperature variability in many global coupled models is less than that observed, with the former due in part to simulated ENSO in the models being generally weaker than observed, and the latter likely to be at least partially due to the uncertainty in the estimates of past radiative forcing; 3) an El Ni\~no\textendash like pattern in the mean SST response with greater surface warming in the eastern equatorial Pacific than the western equatorial Pacific is found by a number of models in global warming climate change experiments, but other models have a more spatially uniform or even a La Ni\~na\textendash like, response; 4) flux adjustment, by definition, improves the simulation of mean present-day climate over oceans, does not guarantee a drift-free climate, but can produce a stable base state in some models to enable very long term (1000 yr and longer) integrations\textemdash in these models it does not appear to have a major effect on model processes or model responses to increasing CO{$_2$}; and 5) recent multicentury integrations show that a stable surface climate can be attained without flux adjustment (though still with some systematic simulation errors).}

Quantifications of the pledges before the 2021 United Nations Climate Change Conference (COP26) suggested a less than 50\,per\,cent chance of keeping warming below 2\,degrees\,Celsius2\textendash 5. Here we show that warming can be kept just below 2\,degrees\,Celsius if all conditional and unconditional pledges are implemented in full and on time. Peak warming could be limited to 1.9\textendash 2.0\,degrees\,Celsius (5\%\textendash 95\% range 1.4\textendash 2.8\,\textdegree C) in the full implementation case\textemdash building on a probabilistic characterization of Earth system uncertainties in line with the Working Group I contribution to the~Sixth Assessment Report6 of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC). We retrospectively project twenty-first-century warming to show how the aggregate level of ambition changed from 2015 to 2021. Our results rely on the extrapolation of time-limited targets beyond 2030 or 2050, characteristics of the IPCC 1.5\,\textdegree C Special Report (SR1.5) scenario database7 and the full implementation of pledges. More pessimistic assumptions on these factors would lead to higher temperature projections. A second, independent emissions modelling framework projected peak warming of 1.8\,degrees\,Celsius, supporting the finding that realized pledges could limit warming to just below 2\,degrees\,Celsius. Limiting warming not only to `just below' but to `well below' 2\,degrees\,Celsius or 1.5\,degrees\,Celsius urgently requires policies and actions to bring about steep emission reductions this decade, aligned with mid-century global net-zero CO2 emissions.},

We develop a probabilistic, process-based valuation of the effects of mangroves on averting damages to people and property. We couple spatially-explicit 2-D hydrodynamic analyses with economic models, and find that mangroves provide flood protection benefits exceeding \$US 65 billion per year. If mangroves were lost, 15 million more people would be flooded annually across the world. Some of the nations that receive the greatest economic benefits include the USA, China, India and Mexico. Vietnam, India and Bangladesh receive the greatest benefits in terms of people protected. Many ({$>$}45) 20-km coastal stretches particularly those near cities receive more than \$US 250\,million annually in flood protection benefits from mangroves. These results demonstrate the value of mangroves as natural coastal defenses at global, national and local scales, which can inform incentives for mangrove conservation and restoration in development, climate adaptation, disaster risk reduction and insurance.},

  title = {Spectral {{Filtering}} for {{Spatio-Temporal Dynamics}} and {{Multivariate Forecasts}}},
  author = {Meng, Lu},
  year = {2016},
  abstract = {Due to the increasing availability of massive spatio-temporal data sets, modeling high dimensional data becomes quite challenging. A large number of research ques- tions are rooted in identifying underlying dynamics in such spatio-temporal data. For many applications, the science suggests that the intrinsic dynamics be smooth and of low dimension. To reduce the variance of estimates and increase the computational tractability, dimension reduction is also quite necessary in the modeling procedure. In this dissertation, we propose a spectral filtering approach for dimension reduction and forecast amelioration, and apply it tomultiple applications. We show the effectiveness of dimension reduction via our method and also illustrate its power for prediction in both simulation and real data examples. The resultant lower dimensional principal component series has a diagonal spectral density at each frequency whose diagonal el- ements are in descending order, which can be hard to interpret. Therefore we propose a phase-based clustering method for eigenvectors in the frequency domain to create principal component series with interpretable dynamics in the time domain. From our simulations and empirical results, our algorithm yields clean and interpretable low rank spatio-temporal dynamics that explain a substantial proportion of the observed data. Benefiting from the zero-coherence property of the principal component series, we subsequently develop a predictive model to capture the low-dimensional dynam- ics. Our modeling approach reduces multivariate modeling task to multiple univariate modeling and can combine with regularization techniques to obtain more stable es- timates and improve interpretability. The following simulation results and real data analysis show that our model achieves superior forecast performance compared to the class of autoregressive models.},

Over recent decades the notion of risk being the basis for flood management decisions has become widely accepted and operationalised through the use of models and quantified risk analysis providing the evidence for risk-informed decision making. However, it is now abundantly apparent that changes in time, at a range of scales, of pertinent variables that determine risk are not a second order consideration but, instead, fundamentally challenge the conventional approach to flood risk management. The nature of some of these changes, particularly those that operate on extended timescales, are highly uncertain, yet decisions that may have implications for several decades still have to be taken. In this paper we explore how flood risk management may be adapted to address processes of uncertain future change. We identify a range of levels at which change may be incorporated in decision making: in the representation of uncertain non-stationary quantities; in the rules that are used to identify preferred options; in the variety of options that may be contemplated for flood risk management; in the scope of problem definition, which increasingly extends to address multiple hazards and multiple functions of river basins; and in the social and organizational characteristics that promote adaptive capacity. Integrated responses to changing flood risk need to attend to each of these levels of decision making, from the technicalities of non-stationarity, to the promotion of resilient societies.{$<$}/p{$>$}}

  abstract = {Statistical distributions of flood peak discharge often show heavy tail behavior, that is, extreme floods are more likely to occur than would be predicted by commonly used distributions that have exponential asymptotic behavior. This heavy tail behavior may surprise flood managers and citizens, as human intuition tends to expect light tail behavior, and the heaviness of the tails is very difficult to predict, which may lead to unnecessarily high flood damage. Despite its high importance, the literature on the heavy tail behavior of flood distributions is rather fragmented. In this review, we provide a coherent overview of the processes causing heavy flood tails and the implications for science and practice. Specifically, we propose nine hypotheses on the mechanisms causing heavy tails in flood peak distributions related to processes in the atmosphere, the catchment, and the river system. We then discuss to which extent the current knowledge supports or contradicts these hypotheses. We also discuss the statistical conditions for the emergence of heavy tail behavior based on derived distribution theory and relate them to the hypotheses and flood generation mechanisms. We review the degree to which the heaviness of the tails can be predicted from process knowledge and data. Finally, we recommend further research toward testing the hypotheses and improving the prediction of heavy tails.}

  abstract = {Flood estimation and flood management have traditionally been the domain of hydrologists, water resources engineers and statisticians, and disciplinary approaches abound. Dominant views have been shaped; one example is the catchment perspective: floods are formed and influenced by the interaction of local, catchment-specific characteristics, such as meteorology, topography and geology. These traditional views have been beneficial, but they have a narrow framing. In this paper we contrast traditional views with broader perspectives that are emerging from an improved understanding of the climatic context of floods. We come to the following conclusions: (1) extending the traditional system boundaries (local catchment, recent decades, hydrological/hydraulic processes) opens up exciting possibilities for better understanding and improved tools for flood risk assessment and management. (2) Statistical approaches in flood estimation need to be complemented by the search for the causal mechanisms and dominant processes in the atmosphere, catchment and river system that leave their fingerprints on flood characteristics. (3) Natural climate variability leads to time-varying flood characteristics, and this variation may be partially quantifiable and predictable, with the perspective of dynamic, climate-informed flood risk management. (4) Efforts are needed to fully account for factors that contribute to changes in all three risk components (hazard, exposure, vulnerability) and to better understand the interactions between society and floods. (5) Given the global scale and societal importance, we call for the organization of an international multidisciplinary collaboration and data-sharing initiative to further understand the links between climate and flooding and to advance flood research.}

  abstract = {In 1997, during the late stages of production of NCEP\textendash NCAR Global Reanalysis (GR), exploration of a regional reanalysis project was suggested by the GR project's Advisory Committee, ``particularly if the RDAS [Regional Data Assimilation System] is significantly better than the global reanalysis at capturing the regional hydrological cycle, the diurnal cycle and other important features of weather and climate variability.'' Following a 6-yr development and production effort, NCEP's North American Regional Reanalysis (NARR) project was completed in 2004, and data are now available to the scientific community. Along with the use of the NCEP Eta model and its Data Assimilation System (at 32-km\textendash 45-layer resolution with 3-hourly output), the hallmarks of the NARR are the incorporation of hourly assimilation of precipitation, which leverages a comprehensive precipitation analysis effort, the use of a recent version of the Noah land surface model, and the use of numerous other datasets that are additional or improved compared to the GR. Following the practice applied to NCEP's GR, the 25-yr NARR retrospective production period (1979\textendash 2003) is augmented by the construction and daily execution of a system for near-real-time continuation of the NARR, known as the Regional Climate Data Assimilation System (R-CDAS). Highlights of the NARR results are presented: precipitation over the continental United States (CONUS), which is seen to be very near the ingested analyzed precipitation; fits of tropospheric temperatures and winds to rawinsonde observations; and fits of 2-m temperatures and 10-m winds to surface station observations. The aforementioned fits are compared to those of the NCEP\textendash Department of Energy (DOE) Global Reanalysis (GR2). Not only have the expectations cited above been fully met, but very substantial improvements in the accuracy of temperatures and winds compared to that of GR2 are achieved throughout the troposphere. Finally, the numerous datasets produced are outlined and information is provided on the data archiving and present data availability.},

Prior elicitation transforms domain knowledge of various kinds into well-defined prior distributions, and offers a solution to the prior specification problem, in principle. In practice, however, we are still fairly far from having usable prior elicitation tools that could significantly influence the way we build probabilistic models in academia and industry. We lack elicitation methods that integrate well into the Bayesian workflow and perform elicitation efficiently in terms of costs of time and effort. We even lack a comprehensive theoretical framework for understanding different facets of the prior elicitation problem. Why are we not widely using prior elicitation? We analyze the state of the art by identifying a range of key aspects of prior knowledge elicitation, from properties of the modelling task and the nature of the priors to the form of interaction with the expert. The existing prior elicitation literature is reviewed and categorized in these terms. This allows recognizing under-studied directions in prior elicitation research, finally leading to a proposal of several new avenues to improve prior elicitation methodology.},

  abstract = {Abstract Over the twenty-first century, the frequency of extreme-heat events for major cities in heavily air conditioned California is projected to increase rapidly. Extreme heat is defined here as the temperature threshold for the 90th-percentile excedence probability (T90) of the local warmest summer days under the current climate. Climate projections from three atmosphere\textendash ocean general circulation models, with a range of low to midhigh temperature sensitivity forced by the Special Report on Emission Scenarios higher, middle, and lower emission scenarios, indicate that these increases in temperature extremes and variance are projected to exceed the rate of increase in mean temperature. Overall, projected increases in extreme heat under the higher A1fi emission scenario by 2070\textendash 99 tend to be 20\%\textendash 30\% higher than those projected under the lower B1 emission scenario. Increases range from approximately 2 times the present-day number of days for inland California cities (e.g., Sacramento and Fresno), up to 4 times for previously temperate coastal cities (e.g., Los Angeles and San Diego), implying that present-day ``heat wave'' conditions may dominate summer months\textemdash and patterns of electricity demand\textemdash in the future. When the projected extreme heat and observed relationships between high temperature and electricity demand for California are mapped onto current availability, maintaining technology and population constant for demand-side calculations, a potential for electricity deficits as high as 17\% during T90 peak electricity demand periods is found. Similar increases in extreme-heat days are likely for other southwestern U.S. urban locations, as well as for large cities in developing nations with rapidly increasing electricity demands. In light of the electricity response to recent extreme-heat events, such as the July 2006 heat waves in California, Missouri, and New York, these results suggest that future increases in peak electricity demand will challenge current transmission and supply methods as well as future planned supply capacities when population and income growth are taken into account.},

Here, we describe the development and assessment of a set of model-based alternative future scenarios examining climate and population driven landscape dynamics for a coastal region in the U.S. Pacific Northwest. These scenarios incorporated coupled spatiotemporal models of climate and coastal hazards, population and development, and policy and assessed a variety of landscape metrics for each scenario. Coastal flooding and erosion were probabilistically simulated using 99 future 95-year climate scenarios. Five policy scenarios were iteratively co-developed by researchers and stakeholders in Tillamook County, Oregon. Results suggest that both climate change and management decisions have a significant impact across the landscape, and can potentially impact geographic regions at different magnitudes and timescales.}

  abstract = {As evidence of climate change strengthens, knowledge of its regional implications becomes an urgent need for decision making. Current understanding of regional precipitation changes is substantially limited by our understanding of the atmospheric circulation response to climate change, which to a high degree remains uncertain. This uncertainty is reflected in the wide spread in atmospheric circulation changes projected in multimodel ensembles, which cannot be directly interpreted in a probabilistic sense. The uncertainty can instead be represented by studying a discrete set of physically plausible storylines of atmospheric circulation changes. By mining CMIP5 model output, here we take this broader perspective and develop storylines for Southern Hemisphere (SH) midlatitude circulation changes, conditioned on the degree of global-mean warming, based on the climate responses of two remote drivers: the enhanced warming of the tropical upper troposphere and the strengthening of the stratospheric polar vortex. For the three continental domains in the SH, we analyse the precipitation changes under each storyline. To allow comparison with previous studies, we also link both circulation and precipitation changes with those of the Southern Annular Mode. Our results show that the response to tropical warming leads to a strengthening of the midlatitude westerly winds, whilst the response to a delayed breakdown (for DJF) or strengthening (for JJA) of the stratospheric vortex leads to a poleward shift of the westerly winds and the storm tracks. However, the circulation response is not zonally symmetric and the regional precipitation storylines for South America, South Africa, South~of Australia and New Zealand exhibit quite specific dependencies on the two remote drivers, which are not well represented by changes in the Southern Annular Mode.}

  abstract = {The theory of reinforcement learning provides a normative account1, deeply rooted in psychological2 and neuroscientific3 perspectives on animal behaviour, of how agents may optimize their control of an environment. To use reinforcement learning successfully in situations approaching real-world complexity, however, agents are confronted with a difficult task: they must derive efficient representations of the environment from high-dimensional sensory inputs, and use these to generalize past experience to new situations. Remarkably, humans and other animals seem to solve this problem through a harmonious combination of reinforcement learning and hierarchical sensory processing systems4,5, the former evidenced by a wealth of neural data revealing notable parallels between the phasic signals emitted by dopaminergic neurons and temporal difference reinforcement learning algorithms3. While reinforcement learning agents have achieved some successes in a variety of domains6,7,8, their applicability has previously been limited to domains in which useful features can be handcrafted, or to domains with fully observed, low-dimensional state spaces. Here we use recent advances in training deep neural networks9,10,11 to develop a novel artificial agent, termed a deep Q-network, that can learn successful policies directly from high-dimensional sensory inputs using end-to-end reinforcement learning. We tested this agent on the challenging domain of classic Atari 2600 games12. We demonstrate that the deep Q-network agent, receiving only the pixels and the game score as inputs, was able to surpass the performance of all previous algorithms and achieve a level comparable to that of a professional human games tester across a set of 49 games, using the same algorithm, network architecture and hyperparameters. This work bridges the divide between high-dimensional sensory inputs and actions, resulting in the first artificial agent that is capable of learning to excel at a diverse array of challenging tasks.},

Supporting robust decision-making needs a sequence of interactive methodological choices for setting the problem context, framing the decision problem, evaluating possible solutions, and making recommendations. These methodological choices are influenced by a variety of human factors, originating from cognitive, behavioural, and mental frameworks of stakeholders. We review a broad array of methodological constructs to better emphasise the choices that are most appropriate given different levels of knowledge. Consideration of these methodological constructs clarifies how problems can be perceived and framed in rival decision support paths emerging from the cumulative effects of individual methodological choices and the challenging human factors that shape decision-making under deep uncertainty. We conclude that the careful consideration of rival decision support paths can enhance the confidence in decision recommendations and illuminate sensitivities to the methodological choices.}

However, uncertainty in various forms challenges inferences from modeling results. Model-based support for decision-making has increasingly adopted an emerging exploratory approach. This approach addresses uncertainty explicitly through systematically exploring the implications of modeling assumptions, aiming to enhance the robustness of inferences from models. Despite a variety of applications, the extent and the way(s) that exploratory modeling can deal with the challenges that arise from the uncertainty and complexity of decision-making with stakeholders has not yet been systematically framed. We address this gap in two ways. First, we present a taxonomy of the ways that exploratory modeling can be used to inform robust inferences in coupled human-natural systems by mapping the technical capabilities of this approach in relation to the diversity of past applications. This subsequently guides an investigation of the practical benefits and challenges of these capabilities in handling uncertainty and complexity. Second, we discuss different ways for integrating genuine stakeholder engagement into exploratory modeling through transdisciplinary research. Finally we outline some priorities for future expansion of this research area.}

  abstract = {This paper analyses transdisciplinarity and discusses the conceptual changes it has undergone during the past decade. Transdisciplinarity is currently perceived as an extended knowledge production including a variety of actors and with an open perception of the relevance of different forms of scientific and lay knowledge. By stressing scope of collaboration, a clearer distinction can be established between interdisciplinarity and transdisciplinarity than was possible with the former focus on degree of integration. However, integration is still an essential feature of transdisciplinarity and in emphasising the need to acknowledge the different roles actors can play in knowledge production a distinction can be identified between two different forms of transdisciplinarity; consulting versus participatory transdisciplinarity. This distinction draws upon the qualitative difference between research conducted including all kinds of actors on equal terms in the knowledge production process (participatory transdisciplinarity) or having actors from outside academia responding and reacting to the research conducted (consulting transdisciplinarity). Both forms fulfil the basic requirements of transdisciplinarity but differ regarding the challenges involved, and thus a distinction needs to be made between them when discussing, commissioning or evaluating research.}

  abstract = {Rescue requests during large-scale urban flood disasters can be difficult to validate and prioritise. High-resolution aerial imagery is often unavailable or lacks the necessary geographic extent, making it difficult to obtain real-time information about where flooding is occurring. In this paper, we present a novel approach to map the extent of urban flooding in Harris County, Texas during Hurricane Harvey (August 25\textendash 30, 2017) and identify where people were most likely to need immediate emergency assistance. Using Maximum Entropy, we predict the probability of flooding based on several spatially-distributed physical and socio-economic characteristics coupled with crowdsourced data. We compare the results against two alternative flood datasets available after Hurricane Harvey (i.e., Copernicus satellite imagery and riverine flood depths estimated by FEMA), and we validate the performance of the model using a 15\% subset of the rescue requests, Houston 311 flood calls, and inundated roadways. We find that the model predicts a much larger area of flooding than was shown by either Copernicus or FEMA when compared against the locations of rescue requests, and that it performs well using both a subset of rescue requests (AUC 0.917) and 311 calls (AUC 0.929) but is less sensitive to inundated roads (AUC 0.721).},

  abstract = {Adopting effective flood mitigation practices for repetitive flood events in the United States continues to play a prominent role in preventing future damage and fostering resilience to residential flooding. Two common mitigation practices for reducing residential flood risk consist of raising an existing structure to or above base flood elevation (BFE) and acquiring chronically damaged properties in flood prone areas and restoring them back to serve their natural functions as green open spaces. However, due to data accuracy limitations, decision makers are faced with the challenge of identifying the financially optimal approach to implementing mitigation measures. We address this problem through the following research questions: What does the optimal allocation of flood mitigation resources look like under data uncertainty, and what are the optimal methods to combining mitigation measures with consideration for the best economic benefits? Using a robust decision making (RDM) approach, the effects of uncertainty in property values, construction and demolition costs, and policy implementation options such as structure selection and budget allocation were measured. Our results indicate that the amount budgeted for mitigation and how those funds are allocated directly influence the selection of the most economically viable mitigation practices. Our research also contributes to the growing need for evaluating specific flood mitigation strategies.},

In the US, the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) Special Flood Hazard Area (SFHA) provides important information about areas subject to flooding during the 1 \% riverine or coastal event. The binary nature of flood hazard maps obscures the distribution of property risk inside of the SFHA and the residual risk outside of the SFHA, which can undermine mitigation efforts. Machine learning techniques provide an alternative approach to estimating flood hazards across large spatial scales at low computational expense. This study presents a pilot study for the Texas Gulf Coast region using random forest classification to predict flood probability across a 30 523 km2 area. Using a record of National Flood Insurance Program (NFIP) claims dating back to 1976 and high-resolution geospatial data, we generate a continuous flood hazard map for 12 US Geological Survey (USGS) eight-digit hydrologic unit code (HUC) watersheds. Results indicate that the random forest model predicts flooding with a high sensitivity (area under the curve, AUC: 0.895), especially compared to the existing FEMA regulatory floodplain. Our model identifies 649 000 structures with at least a 1 \% annual chance of flooding, roughly 3 times more than are currently identified by FEMA as flood-prone.}

Using a bivariate approach, there are many possible combinations of Q and H that jointly reflect a specific return period, T, raising questions about the best choice as boundary forcing in a hydrodynamic model. We show, first of all, how possible Q and H values depend on whether the definition of T corresponds to the probability of exceedance of ``H OR Q'' or ``H AND Q''. We also show that flood hazards defined by ``OR'' return periods are more conservative than ``AND'' return periods. Finally, we introduce a new composite water surface profile to represent the spatially distributed hazard for return period T. The composite profile synthesizes hydrodynamic model results from the ``AND'' hazard scenario and two scenarios based on traditional univariate analysis, a ``Marginal Q'' scenario and a ``Marginal H'' scenario.}

Here we analyze the likelihood of exceedances above mean higher high water and the corresponding property value exposure for minor, major, and extreme coastal floods. Our results suggest that, in response to sea level rise, nuisance flooding (NF) could generate property value exposure comparable to, or larger than, extreme events. Determining whether (and when) low cost, nuisance incidents aggregate into high cost impacts and deciding when to invest in preventive measures are among the most difficult decisions for policymakers. It would be unfortunate if efforts to protect societies from extreme events (e.g., 0.01 annual probability) left them exposed to a cumulative hazard with enormous costs. We propose a Cumulative Hazard Index (CHI) as a tool for framing the future cumulative impact of low cost incidents relative to infrequent extreme events. CHI suggests that in New York, NY, Washington, DC, Miami, FL, San Francisco, CA, and Seattle, WA, a careful consideration of socioeconomic impacts of NF for prioritization is crucial for sustainable coastal flood risk management.}

For some time-scales, (e.g., seasonal), the driver-shoreline relationship is often evident, however, at longer time-scales (e.g., multi-annual), the shoreline changes may be superimposed on changes at shorter time-scales and thus are difficult to identify. Here, we predict shoreline evolution from storm events to decadal time-scales, using a novel approach based on the Complete Ensemble Empirical Mode Decomposition. This approach identifies and links the primary time-scales in the model drivers (large-scale sea level pressure and/or waves) with the same time-scales in the shoreline position. The multi-scale approach reproduced shoreline changes at two beaches more skillfully than a common shoreline model when sea level pressure and wave information were used in combination. In addition, the analysis can be applied to climate indices, providing the opportunity to link longer time-scales with climate patterns (e.g., El Ni\~no Southern Oscillation).},

As part of a process termed ``decision scaling,'' a climate response function was developed to isolate the impact of climate change on a water system in terms of hazards identified by stakeholders. The climate response function was then used to evaluate system performance over a wide range of climate conditions and to define robustness indicators. The robustness indicators, which measure system performance as a function of climate state, are conditioned on explicit assumptions about climate variable probability distributions. To illustrate this process, it is applied to the upper Great Lakes to evaluate system robustness related to water management decisions and assess the impact of climate probability assumptions. The robustness indicators were used to identify decisions that outperformed other courses of action regardless of assumptions of future climate probabilities.}

This study addresses the latter, which modelers use to predict, for example, streamflow at some future time given knowledge of the current state of the system and model parameters. In this respect, good estimates of the parameters and state variables are needed to enable the model to generate accurate forecasts. In this paper, a dual state\textendash parameter estimation approach is presented based on the Ensemble Kalman Filter (EnKF) for sequential estimation of both parameters and state variables of a hydrologic model. A systematic approach for identification of the perturbation factors used for ensemble generation and for selection of ensemble size is discussed. The dual EnKF methodology introduces a number of novel features: (1) both model states and parameters can be estimated simultaneously; (2) the algorithm is recursive and therefore does not require storage of all past information, as is the case in the batch calibration procedures; and (3) the various sources of uncertainties can be properly addressed, including input, output, and parameter uncertainties. The applicability and usefulness of the dual EnKF approach for ensemble streamflow forecasting is demonstrated using a conceptual rainfall-runoff model.}

The aim of this study is to analyse the effect of temperatures on the variability of the Spanish daily electricity demand, and especially to characterise the non-linearity of the response of demand to variations in temperature. In this article, we explore the ability of Smooth Transition (STR), Threshold Regression (TR), and Switching Regressions (SR) models, to handle both aspects. As we conclude, the use of LSTR approach offers two main advantages. First, it captures adequately the smooth response of electricity demand to temperature variations in intermediate ranges of temperatures. Second, it provides a method to analyse the validity of temperature thresholds used to build the ``cooling degree days'' (CDD) and ``heating degree days'' (HDD) variables traditionally employed in the literature.}

  abstract = {A variety of decision makers need projections of future energy demand, CO2 emissions and similar factors that extend many decades into the future. The past performance of such projections has been systematically overconfident. Analysts have often used scenarios based on detailed story lines that spell out ``plausible alternative futures'' as a central tool for evaluating uncertainty. No probabilities are typically assigned to such scenarios. We argue that this practice is often ineffective. Rather than expanding people's judgment about the range of uncertainty about the future, scenario-based analysis is more likely to lead to systematic overconfidence, to an underestimate of the range of possible future outcomes. We review relevant findings from the literature on human judgment under uncertainty and discuss their relevance to the task of making probabilistic projections. The more detail that one adds to the story line of a scenario, the more probable it will appear to most people, and the greater the difficulty they likely will have in imagining other, equally or more likely, ways in which the same outcome could be reached. We suggest that scenario based approaches make analysts particularly prone to such cognitive biases, and then outline a strategy by which improved projections, tailored to the needs of specific decision makers, might be developed.}

The local scaling method calibrates raw GCM daily rainfall at the closest grid point to a given station so that the climatological distribution of rainfall matches the observed one. The {$<$}em{$>$}k{$<$}/em{$>$}-nearest neighbor and weather classification schemes resample historical station rainfall observations according to the similarity between the daily wind fields from an ensemble of GCM simulations and a historical library of reanalysis [from 40-yr ECMWF Re-Analysis (ERA-40)] daily wind fields. The nonhomogenous hidden Markov model uses a small set of hidden states to describe the relationship between daily station rainfall observations and low-pass-filtered simulated winds to simulate stochastic sequences of daily rainfall. The four methods are assessed in terms of seasonal statistics of daily rainfall, including seasonal amount, rainfall frequency, and the mean length of wet and dry spells. Verification measures used are mean bias error, interannual anomaly correlation, root-mean-square error, and ranked probability skill score.{$<$}/p{$><$}p{$>$}The {$<$}em{$>$}k{$<$}/em{$>$}-nearest neighbor and weather-type classification are shown to perform similarly well in reproducing the mean seasonal cycle, interannual variability of seasonal amount, daily rainfall frequency, as well as the mean length of dry and wet spells, and generally slightly better than the nonhomogeneous hidden Markov model. All three methods are shown to outperform the simple local scaling method. This is due to (i) the ability of the GCM to reproduce remarkably well the mean seasonal cycle and the transitions between weather types defined from reanalysis and (ii) the GCM's moderate-to-strong skill in reproducing the interannual variability of the frequency occurrence of the weather types that strongly influence the interannual variability of rainfall in Senegal. In contrast, the local scaling exaggerates the length of wet and dry spells and reproduces less accurately the interannual variability of the seasonal-averaged amounts, occurrences, and dry/wet spells. This failure is attributed primarily to systematic errors in the GCM's precipitation simulation.{$<$}/p{$><$}/section{$>$}},

  abstract = {Six weather types (WTs) are computed across the Maritime Continent during austral summer (September--April) using cluster analysis of unfiltered, daily, low-level winds at 850 hPa, by a k-means algorithm. This approach is shown to provide a unified view of the interactions across scales, from island-scale diurnal circulations to large-scale interannual ones. The WTs are interpreted either as snapshots of the intraseasonal Madden-Julian Oscillation (MJO); or as seasonal features, such as the transition between boreal- and austral-summer monsoons; or as slow variations associated with the El Ni\o --Southern Oscillation (ENSO). Scale interactions are analyzed in terms of the different phenomena that modulate regional-scale wind speed and direction, or the diurnal-cycle strength of rainfall. Decomposing atmospheric anomalies, relative to the mean annual cycle, into interannual and sub-seasonal components yields similar WT structures on both of these time scales for most of the WTs (4 out of 6). This result suggests that slow (viz. ENSO) and fast (viz. MJO) oscillatory variations superimposed on the mean annual cycle modulate the occurrence rate of WTs, without modifying radically their mean patterns. The latter pattern invariance holds especially true for MJO-type, propagating variations, while the quasi-stationary, planetary-scale ENSO variations have more impact on WT structure. These findings are interpreted with the help of dynamical systems theory. Interannual modulation of WT frequency is strongest for the ``transitional" WTs between the boreal- and austral-summer monsoons, as well as for the ``quiescent" WT, for which low-level winds are reduced over the whole of monsoonal Indonesia. The WT that characterizes NW monsoon surges, and peaks during the austral-summer monsoon in January-February, does not appear to be strongly modulated at the interannual time scale. The diurnal cycle is shown to play an important role in determining the rainfall over islands.}

  abstract = {The generalized extreme value (GEV) distribution is a standard tool for modeling flood peaks, both in annual maximum series (AMS) and in partial duration series (PDS). In this paper, combined maximum likelihood estimation (MLE) and L moment (LMOM) procedures are developed for estimating location, shape, and scale parameters of the GEV distribution. Particular attention is given to estimation of the shape parameter, which determines the ``thickness'' of the upper tail of the flood frequency distribution. Mixed MLE\textendash LMOM methods avoid problems with both MLE (estimator variance) and LMOM (estimator bias) estimators of the shape parameter. The mixed MLE\textendash LMOM procedure is extended to use the two largest flood peaks in a year. This extension is developed in a PDS framework. Estimation procedures are applied to flood peak observations from 104 central Appalachian basins. The estimated values of the shape parameter for the central Appalachian basins are more negative than has been considered physically reasonable, independent of the estimation procedure that is used. Twenty-eight percent of mixed method estimators of the shape parameter have values less than -0.5, implying that the moments of order 2 and above are infinite. The estimated shape parameters for the central Appalachian basins do not depend on basin morphological parameters (such as drainage area) or land cover properties (such as percent urban, forest, or agricultural land use). Estimated values of the location and scale parameters for the central Appalachian watersheds correspond well with GEV-based simple scaling theory. Estimated values of the shape parameter for central Appalachian watersheds are shown to differ markedly from those of southern Appalachian watersheds and the difference is shown to be linked to contrasting properties of extreme floods. To conclude the paper, analyses of mixture distribution models are presented to address the question of whether flood peaks really have extreme ``heavy tail'' behavior or whether the GEV distribution is not the appropriate model for flood peaks.},

  abstract = {Floods are among the most destructive natural disasters, which are highly complex to model. The research on the advancement of flood prediction models contributed to risk reduction, policy suggestion, minimization of the loss of human life, and reduction of the property damage associated with floods. To mimic the complex mathematical expressions of physical processes of floods, during the past two decades, machine learning (ML) methods contributed highly in the advancement of prediction systems providing better performance and cost-effective solutions. Due to the vast benefits and potential of ML, its popularity dramatically increased among hydrologists. Researchers through introducing novel ML methods and hybridizing of the existing ones aim at discovering more accurate and efficient prediction models. The main contribution of this paper is to demonstrate the state of the art of ML models in flood prediction and to give insight into the most suitable models. In this paper, the literature where ML models were benchmarked through a qualitative analysis of robustness, accuracy, effectiveness, and speed are particularly investigated to provide an extensive overview on the various ML algorithms used in the field. The performance comparison of ML models presents an in-depth understanding of the different techniques within the framework of a comprehensive evaluation and discussion. As a result, this paper introduces the most promising prediction methods for both long-term and short-term floods. Furthermore, the major trends in improving the quality of the flood prediction models are investigated. Among them, hybridization, data decomposition, algorithm ensemble, and model optimization are reported as the most effective strategies for the improvement of ML methods. This survey can be used as a guideline for hydrologists as well as climate scientists in choosing the proper ML method according to the prediction task.},

  abstract = {Compound flooding (CF), as a result of oceanic, hydrological, meteorological and anthropogenic drivers, is often studied with hydrodynamic models that combine either successive or concurrent processes to simulate inundation dynamics. In recent years, convolutional neural networks (CNNs) and data fusion (DF) techniques have emerged as effective alternatives for post-flood mapping and supported current efforts of complex physical and dynamical modeling. Yet, those techniques have not been explored for large-scale (regional) compound flood mapping. Here, we evaluate the performance of a CNN \& DF framework for generating CF maps along the southeast Atlantic coast of the U.S. as a result of Hurricane Matthew (October 2016). The framework fuses multispectral imagery from Landsat analysis ready data (ARD), dual-polarized synthetic aperture radar data (SAR), and coastal digital elevation models (DEMs) to produce flood maps at moderate (30 m) spatial resolution. The highest overall accuracy (97\%) and f1-scores of permanent water/floodwater (99/100\%) are achieved when ARD, SAR and DEM datasets are readily available and fused. Moreover, the resulting CF maps agree well (80\%) with hindcast flood guidance maps of the Coastal Emergency Risk Assessment and can effectively match postflood high water marks of the U.S. Geological Survey distributed in coastal counties. We ultimately evaluate the framework with different DF alternatives and highlight their usefulness for large-scale compound flood mapping as well as calibration of hydrodynamic models. The cost-effective approach proposed here enables efficient estimation of exposure to compound coastal flooding and is particularly useful in data scarce regions.}

Its overall goal is to improve risk assessments, set up early warning systems, support decision-making processes, and provide easily and intuitively understandable spatial maps to end users. The initiative works under the scientific and logistic coordination of the Centro de Modelado Cient\'ifico (CMC) at Zulia University, Venezuela, and the Centro Internacional para la Investigaci\'on del Fen\'omeno ``El Ni\~no'' (CIIFEN), and it is operated at a local level by the national weather services (NWSs) of the above-mentioned six Andean nations. The OA provides several freely available model outputs, including meteorological and hydrological forecasts, droughts, fire and flood indices, ecosystems dynamics, climate and health applications, and 5-day high-resolution oceanographic predictions for the eastern Pacific. This article briefly describes the current products, methodologies, and dynamical and statistical modeling outputs provided by the OA. Also, a discussion on how these sets of tools have been put together as a coordinated scientific watch and forecast system for each country and for the entire region is presented. Our experiences over the past 2 yr suggest that this initiative would significantly improve the current decision-making processes in Andean countries.}

  abstract = {The Lake Maracaibo Basin in North Western Venezuela has the highest annual lightning rate of any place in the world ( 200 fl km- 2 yr- 1), whose electrical discharges occasionally impact human and animal lives (e.g., cattle) and frequently affect economic activities like oil and natural gas exploitation. Lightning activity is so common in this region that it has a proper name: Catatumbo Lightning (plural). Although short-term lightning forecasts are now common in different parts of the world, to the best of the authors' knowledge, seasonal prediction of lightning activity is still non-existent. This research discusses the relative role of both large-scale and local climate drivers as modulators of lightning activity in the region, and presents a formal predictability study at seasonal scale. Analysis of the Catatumbo Lightning Regional Mode, defined in terms of the second Empirical Orthogonal Function of monthly Lightning Imaging Sensor (LIS-TRMM) and Optical Transient Detector (OTD) satellite data for North Western South America, permits the identification of potential predictors at seasonal scale via a Canonical Correlation Analysis. Lightning activity in North Western Venezuela responds to well defined sea-surface temperature patterns (e.g., El Ni\~no-Southern Oscillation, Atlantic Meridional Mode) and changes in the low-level meridional wind field that are associated with the Inter-Tropical Convergence Zone migrations, the Caribbean Low Level Jet and tropical cyclone activity, but it is also linked to local drivers like convection triggered by the topographic configuration and the effect of the Maracaibo Basin Nocturnal Low Level Jet. The analysis indicates that at seasonal scale the relative contribution of the large-scale drivers is more important than the local (basin-wide) ones, due to the synoptic control imposed by the former. Furthermore, meridional CAPE transport at 925 mb is identified as the best potential predictor for lightning activity in the Lake Maracaibo Basin. It is found that the predictive skill is slightly higher for the minimum lightning season (JanFeb) than for the maximum one (SepOct), but that in general the skill is high enough to be useful for decision-making processes related to human safety, oil and natural gas exploitation, energy and food security.}

This model involves the same actions and events as the standard (i.e., static) cost\textendash loss ratio situation, but the former (unlike the latter) is dynamic in the sense that it possesses characteristics (e.g., decisions, events) that are related over time. We assume that the decision maker wants to choose the sequence of actions over an {$<$}em{$>$}n{$<$}/em{$>$}-occasion time period that minimizes the total expected expense. A computational technique known as stochastic dynamic programming is employed to determine this optimal policy and the total expected expense.{$<$}/p{$><$}p{$>$}Three types of weather information are considered in studying the value of forecasts in this context: 1) climatological information; 2) perfect information; and 3) imperfect forecasts. Climatological and perfect information represent lower and upper bounds, respectively, on the quality of all imperfect forecasts, with the latter considered here to be categorical forecasts properly calibrated according to their past performance. Theoretical results are presented regarding the form of the optimal policy and the relationship among the total expected expenses for these three types of information. In addition, quality/value relationships for imperfect forecasts are described.{$<$}/p{$><$}p{$>$}Numerical results are derived from the dynamic model for specific values of the model parameters. These results include the optimal policy and the economic value of perfect and imperfect forecasts for various time horizons, climatological probabilities, and values of the cost\textendash loss ratio. The relationship between the accuracy and value of imperfect forecasts also is examined.{$<$}/p{$><$}p{$>$}Several possible extensions of this dynamic model are briefly discussed, including decision-making problems involving more actions and/or events, more complex structures of the costs and losses, and more general forms of imperfect forecasts (e.g., probability forecasts).{$<$}/p{$><$}/section{$>$}},

  abstract = {Understanding the response of atmospheric blocking events to climate change has been of great interest in recent years. However, potential changes in the blocking area (size), which can affect the spatiotemporal characteristics of the resulting extreme events, have not received much attention. Using two large-ensemble, fully coupled general circulation model (GCM) simulations, we show that the size of blocking events increases with climate change, particularly in the Northern Hemisphere (by as much as 17\%). Using a two-layer quasi-geostrophic model and a dimensional analysis technique, we derive a scaling law for the size of blocking events, which shows that area mostly scales with width of the jet times the Kuo scale (i.e., the length of stationary Rossby waves). The scaling law is validated in a range of idealized GCM simulations. Predictions of this scaling law agree well with changes in blocking events' size under climate change in fully coupled GCMs in winters but not in summers.},

In: Malv\'arez, G. and Navas, F. (eds.), Global Coastal Issues of 2020. Journal of Coastal Research, Special Issue No. 95, pp. 1211-1216. Coconut Creek (Florida), ISSN 0749-0208.Coastal hazards such as storm surge, waves, currents, wind, and rainfall associated with extratropical and tropical cyclones (e.g., hurricanes) can have devastating effects and threaten the lives of millions of people living along the world's coastlines. This has led to the development of the Coastal Hazards System (CHS), an ambitious program with the primary goal of quantifying extreme coastal hazards due to both tropical and extratropical cyclones. The CHS currently covers all U.S. hurricane-prone coastlines along the Gulf of Mexico, the Atlantic seaboard, Puerto Rico, and the U.S. Virgin Islands, as well as regions affected only by extratropical storms like the Great Lakes. The Probabilistic Coastal Hazard Analysis (PCHA) is an innovative statistical and probabilistic framework that serves as the foundation of the CHS. This framework includes comprehensive characterization of storm climatology, high-resolution numerical modeling, and advanced joint probability analysis of atmospheric forcing and primary storm responses, including associated aleatory and epistemic uncertainties. New PCHA advancements overcome limitations of previous joint probability methods by integrating meta-Gaussian copula for the computation of storm probabilities, spatially-varying bias and uncertainty quantification, and Gaussian process metamodel (GPM) based on existing CHS synthetic tropical cyclones. GPM emulates the response of computationally-expensive hydrodynamic models and enables the generation of augmented tropical cyclone suites, consisting of up to millions of storms, for optimal coverage of the parameter and probability spaces. The CHS also includes a database and a web-based data mining and visualization system for public distribution of high-fidelity probabilistic, atmospheric and hydrodynamic modeling results. PCHA results are distributed along with the corresponding metadata, in self-describing data formats for easy and efficient use by engineers, planners, economists, emergency managers, and researchers.}

  abstract = {Weather regime based stochastic weather generators (WR-SWGs) have recently been proposed as a tool to better understand multi-sector vulnerability to deeply uncertain climate change. WR-SWGs can distinguish and simulate different types of climate change that have varying degrees of uncertainty in future projections, including thermodynamic changes (e.g., rising temperatures, Clausius-Clapeyron scaling of extreme precipitation) and dynamic changes (e.g., shifting circulation and storm tracks). These models require the accurate identification of WRs that are representative of both historical and plausible future patterns of atmospheric circulation, while preserving the complex space\textendash time variability of weather processes. This study proposes a novel framework to identify such WRs based on WR-SWG performance over a broad geographic area and applies this framework to a case study in California. We test two components of WR-SWG design, including the method used for WR identification (Hidden Markov Models (HMMs) vs. K-means clustering) and the number of WRs. For different combinations of these components, we assess performance of a multi-site WR-SWG using 14 metrics across 13 major California river basins during the cold season. Results show that performance is best using a small number of WRs (4\textendash 5) identified using an HMM. We then juxtapose the number of WRs selected based on WR-SWG performance against the number of regimes identified using metastability analysis of atmospheric fields. Results show strong agreement in the number of regimes between the two approaches, suggesting that the use of metastable regimes could inform WR-SWG design. We conclude with a discussion of the potential to expand this framework for additional WR-SWG design parameters and spatial scales.},

  abstract = {A nonparametric stochastic model is developed and tested for the simulation of tropical cyclone tracks. Tropical cyclone tracks demonstrate continuity and memory over many time and space steps. Clusters of tracks can be coherent, and the separation between clusters may be marked by geographical locations where groups of tracks diverge as a result of the physics of the underlying process. Consequently, their evolution may be non-Markovian. Markovian simulation models, as are often used, may produce tracks that potentially diverge or lose memory quicker than happens in nature. This is addressed here through a model that simulates tracks by randomly sampling track segments of varying length, selected from historical tracks. For performance evaluation, a spatial grid is imposed on the domain of interest. For each grid box, long-term tropical cyclone risk is assessed through the annual probability distributions of the number of storm hours, landfalls, winds, and other statistics. Total storm length is determined at birth by local distribution, and movement to other tropical cyclone segments by distance to neighbor tracks, comparative vector, and age of track. The model is also applied to the conditional simulation of hurricane tracks from specific positions for hurricanes that were not included in the model fitting so as to see whether the probabilistic coverage intervals properly cover the subsequent track. Consequently, tests of both the long-term probability distributions of hurricane landfall and of event simulations from the model are provided.}

In this comment, I discuss some of these issues from a scientific perspective. What goal does model selection serve when all models are known to be systematically wrong? How might ``toy problems'' tell a misleading story? How does the scientific goal of explanation align with (or differ from) traditional statistical concerns? I do not offer answers to these questions, but hope to highlight the reasons why psychological researchers cannot avoid asking them.}

  abstract = {This monograph uses the Julia language to guide the reader through an exploration of the fundamental concepts of probability and statistics, all with a view of mastering machine learning, data science, and artificial intelligence. The text does not require any prior statistical knowledge and only assumes a basic understanding of programming and mathematical notation. It is accessible to practitioners and researchers in data science, machine learning, bio-statistics, finance, or engineering who may wish to solidify their knowledge of probability and statistics. The book progresses through ten independent chapters starting with an introduction of Julia, and moving through basic probability, distributions, statistical inference, regression analysis, machine learning methods, and the use of Monte Carlo simulation for dynamic stochastic models. Ultimately this text introduces the Julia programming language as a computational tool, uniquely addressing end-users rather than developers. It makes heavy use of over 200 code examples to illustrate dozens of key statistical concepts. The Julia code, written in a simple format with parameters that can be easily modified, is also available for download from the book's associated GitHub repository online.See what co-creators of the Julia language are saying about the book:Professor Alan Edelman, MIT: With ``Statistics with Julia'', Yoni and Hayden have written an easy to read, well organized, modern introduction to statistics. The code may be looked at, and understood on the static pages of a book, or even better, when running live on a computer. Everything you need is here in one nicely written self-contained reference. Dr. Viral Shah, CEO of Julia Computing: Yoni and Hayden provide a modern way to learn statistics with the Julia programming language. This book has been perfected through iteration over several semesters in the classroom. It prepares the reader with two complementary skills - statistical reasoning with hands on experience and working with large datasets through training in Julia.},

  abstract = {Flood inundation modeling across large data sparse areas has been increasing in recent years, driven by a desire to provide hazard information for a wider range of locations. The sophistication of these models has steadily advanced over the past decade due to improvements in remote sensing and modeling capability. There are now several global flood models (GFMs) that seek to simulate water surface dynamics across all rivers and floodplains regardless of data scarcity. However, flood models in data sparse areas lack river bathymetry because this cannot be observed remotely, meaning that a variety of methods for approximating river bathymetry have been developed from uniform flow or downstream hydraulic geometry theory. We argue that bathymetry estimation in these models should follow gradually varying flow theory to account for both uniform and nonuniform flows. We demonstrate that existing methods for bathymetry estimation in GFMs are only accurate for kinematic water surface profiles and are unable to simulate unbiased water surface profiles for reaches with diffusive or shallow water wave properties. The use of gradually varied flow theory to estimate bathymetry in a GFM reduced model error compared to a target water surface profile by 66\% and eliminated bias due to backwater effects. For a large-scale test case in Mozambique this reduced flood extents by 40\% and floodplain storage by 79\% at the 5 years return period. The wet bias associated with uniform flow derived channels could have significant implications for modeling the role floodplains play in attenuating river discharges, potentially overstating their role.}

  abstract = {Wind power is a vital ingredient for energy system transformation in line with the Paris Agreement. Limited land availability for onshore wind parks and higher wind speeds over sea make offshore wind energy increasingly attractive. While wind variability on different timescales poses challenges for planning and system integration, little focus has been given to multi-decadal variability. Our research therefore focuses on the characteristics of wind power on timescales exceeding ten years. Based on detrended wind data from the coupled centennial reanalysis CERA-20C, we calculate European long-term offshore wind power potential and analyze its variability focusing on three locations with distinct climatic conditions: the German North Sea, the Greek Mediterranean and the Portuguese Atlantic coast. We find strong indications for two significant multi-decadal modes that are identified consistently using two independent spectral analysis methods and in the 20-year running mean time series. In winter, the long-term evolution of wind power and the North Atlantic Oscillation (NAO) are directly linked in Germany and Portugal. While German North Sea wind power is positively correlated with the NAO (r D 0:82), Portuguese Atlantic coast generation is anti-correlated with the NAO (r D 0:91). We evaluate the corresponding potential for spatial balancing in Europe and report substantial benefits from European cooperation. In particular, optimized allocations off the Portuguese Atlantic coast and in the German North Sea allow to reduce multi-decadal generation variance by a factor of 3-10 compared with country-level approaches. \textcopyright{} Author(s) 2021.

It became operational in 2018 and has since expanded geographically. This forecasting system consists of four subsystems: data validation, stage forecasting, inundation modeling, and alert distribution. Machine learning is used for two of the subsystems. Stage forecasting is modeled with the long short-term memory (LSTM) networks and the linear models. Flood inundation is computed with the thresholding and the manifold models, where the former computes inundation extent and the latter computes both inundation extent and depth. The manifold model, presented here for the first time, provides a machine-learning alternative to hydraulic modeling of flood inundation. When evaluated on historical data, all models achieve sufficiently high-performance metrics for operational use. The LSTM showed higher skills than the linear model, while the thresholding and manifold models achieved similar performance metrics for modeling inundation extent. During the 2021 monsoon season, the flood warning system was operational in India and Bangladesh, covering flood-prone regions around rivers with a total area close to 470 000 km\textsuperscript{2}, home to more than 350 000 000 people. More than 100 000 000 flood alerts were sent to affected populations, to relevant authorities, and to emergency organizations. Current and future work on the system includes extending coverage to additional flood-prone locations and improving modeling capabilities and accuracy.{$<$}/p{$>$}}

  abstract = {The Pacific decadal oscillation (PDO), the dominant year-round pattern of monthly North Pacific sea surface temperature (SST) variability, is an important target of ongoing research within the meteorological and climate dynamics communities and is central to the work of many geologists, ecologists, natural resource managers, and social scientists. Research over the last 15 years has led to an emerging consensus: the PDO is not a single phenomenon, but is instead the result of a combination of different physical processes, including both remote tropical forcing and local North Pacific atmosphere\textendash ocean interactions, which operate on different time scales to drive similar PDO-like SST anomaly patterns. How these processes combine to generate the observed PDO evolution, including apparent regime shifts, is shown using simple autoregressive models of increasing spatial complexity. Simulations of recent climate in coupled GCMs are able to capture many aspects of the PDO, but do so based on a balance of processes often more independent of the tropics than is observed. Finally, it is suggested that the assessment of PDO-related regional climate impacts, reconstruction of PDO-related variability into the past with proxy records, and diagnosis of Pacific variability within coupled GCMs should all account for the effects of these different processes, which only partly represent the direct forcing of the atmosphere by North Pacific Ocean SSTs.}

  abstract = {This study is concerned with the connections between the large-scale environment and the seasonal occurrence of rapid intensification (RI) of North Atlantic tropical cyclones. Physically-motivated statistical analysis using observations and reanalysis products suggests that for tropical cyclones over the open tropical North Atlantic, the interannual variability of the probability of storms undergoing RI is influenced by seasonal large-scale atmospheric and oceanic variables, but not so for storms over the Gulf of Mexico and western Caribbean Sea. We suggest that this differentiated response is due to the former region exhibiting a strong negative correlation between the seasonal anomalies of vertical wind shear and potential intensity. Differences in the mean climatology and subseasonal variations of the large-scale environment in these regions appear to play an insignificant role in the distinctive seasonal environmental controls on RI. We suggest that the interannual correlation of vertical wind shear and potential intensity is an indicator of seasonal predictability of tropical cyclone activity (including RI) across the tropics .}

  abstract = {Modeling weather and climate is an essential endeavor to understand the near- and long-term impacts of climate change, as well as inform technology and policymaking for adaptation and mitigation efforts. In recent years, there has been a surging interest in applying data-driven methods based on machine learning for solving core problems such as weather forecasting and climate downscaling. Despite promising results, much of this progress has been impaired due to the lack of large-scale, open-source efforts for reproducibility, resulting in the use of inconsistent or underspecified datasets, training setups, and evaluations by both domain scientists and artificial intelligence researchers. We introduce ClimateLearn, an open-source PyTorch library that vastly simplifies the training and evaluation of machine learning models for data-driven climate science. ClimateLearn consists of holistic pipelines for dataset processing (e.g., ERA5, CMIP6, PRISM), implementation of state-of-the-art deep learning models (e.g., Transformers, ResNets), and quantitative and qualitative evaluation for standard weather and climate modeling tasks. We supplement these functionalities with extensive documentation, contribution guides, and quickstart tutorials to expand access and promote community growth. We have also performed comprehensive forecasting and downscaling experiments to showcase the capabilities and key features of our library. To our knowledge, ClimateLearn is the first large-scale, open-source effort for bridging research in weather and climate modeling with modern machine learning systems. Our library is available publicly at https://github.com/aditya-grover/climate-learn.},

  abstract = {Most state-of-the-art approaches for weather and climate modeling are based on physics-informed numerical models of the atmosphere. These approaches aim to model the non-linear dynamics and complex interactions between multiple variables, which are challenging to approximate. Additionally, many such numerical models are computationally intensive, especially when modeling the atmospheric phenomenon at a fine-grained spatial and temporal resolution. Recent data-driven approaches based on machine learning instead aim to directly solve a downstream forecasting or projection task by learning a data-driven functional mapping using deep neural networks. However, these networks are trained using curated and homogeneous climate datasets for specific spatiotemporal tasks, and thus lack the generality of numerical models. We develop and demonstrate ClimaX, a flexible and generalizable deep learning model for weather and climate science that can be trained using heterogeneous datasets spanning different variables, spatio-temporal coverage, and physical groundings. ClimaX extends the Transformer architecture with novel encoding and aggregation blocks that allow effective use of available compute while maintaining general utility. ClimaX is pre-trained with a self-supervised learning objective on climate datasets derived from CMIP6. The pre-trained ClimaX can then be fine-tuned to address a breadth of climate and weather tasks, including those that involve atmospheric variables and spatio-temporal scales unseen during pretraining. Compared to existing data-driven baselines, we show that this generality in ClimaX results in superior performance on benchmarks for weather forecasting and climate projections, even when pretrained at lower resolutions and compute budgets.},

  abstract = {This paper presents a new multi-objective deep reinforcement learning (MODRL) framework based on deep Q-networks. We propose the use of linear and non-linear methods to develop the MODRL framework that includes both single-policy and multi-policy strategies. The experimental results on two benchmark problems including the two-objective deep sea treasure environment and the three-objective mountain car problem indicate that the proposed framework is able to converge to the optimal Pareto solutions effectively. The proposed framework is generic, which allows implementation of different deep reinforcement learning algorithms in different complex environments. This therefore overcomes many difficulties involved with standard multi-objective reinforcement learning (MORL) methods existing in the current literature. The framework creates a platform as a testbed environment to develop methods for solving various problems associated with the current MORL. Details of the framework implementation can be referred to http://www.deakin.edu.au/\textasciitilde thanhthi/drl.htm.},

  abstract = {Responses of extreme precipitation to global warming are of great importance to society and ecosystems. Although observations and climate projections indicate a general intensification of extreme precipitation with warming on global scale, there are significant variations on the regional scale, mainly due to changes in the vertical motion associated with extreme precipitation. Here, we apply quasigeostrophic diagnostics on climate-model simulations to understand the changes in vertical motion, quantifying the roles of dry (large-scale adiabatic flow) and moist (small-scale convection) dynamics in shaping the regional patterns of extreme precipitation sensitivity (EPS). The dry component weakens in the subtropics but strengthens in the middle and high latitudes; the moist component accounts for the positive centers of EPS in the low latitudes and also contributes to the negative centers in the subtropics. A theoretical model depicts a nonlinear relationship between the diabatic heating feedback ({$\alpha$}) and precipitable water, indicating high sensitivity of {$\alpha$} (thus, EPS) over climatological moist regions. The model also captures the change of {$\alpha$} due to competing effects of increases in precipitable water and dry static stability under global warming. Thus, the dry/moist decomposition provides a quantitive and intuitive explanation of the main regional features of EPS.},

  abstract = {Long-range water planning is complicated by factors that are rapidly changing in the 21st century, including climate, population, and water use. Here, we analyze climate factors and drought projections for Texas as an example of a diverse society straddling an aridity gradient to examine how the projections can best serve water stakeholder needs. We find that climate models are robust in projecting drying of summer-season soil moisture and decreasing reservoir supplies for both the eastern and western portions of Texas during the 21st century. Further, projections indicate drier conditions during the latter half of the 21st century than even the most arid centuries of the last 1,000 years that included megadroughts. To illustrate how accounting for drought non-stationarity may increase water resiliency, we consider generalized case studies involving four key stakeholder groups: agricultural producers, large surface water suppliers, small groundwater management districts, and regional water planning districts. We also examine an example of customized climate information being used as input to long-range water planning. We find that while stakeholders value the quantitative capability of climate model outputs, more specific climate-related information better supports resilience planning across multiple stakeholder groups. New suites of tools could provide necessary capacity for both short and long-term, stakeholder-specific adaptive planning.},

  abstract = {When The Impact of Global Warming on Texas was first published in 1995, it discussed climate change as a likely future phenomenon, predicted by scientific studies. This entirely rewritten second edition presents evidence that early climate change impacts can now be observed and identifies the threats climate change will pose to Texas through the year 2050. It also offers the hopeful message that corrective action, if taken now, can avert unmanageable consequences.The book begins with a discussion of climate science and modeling and the information that can be derived from these sources for Texas. The authors follow this with an analysis of actual climate trends in the various Texas climate regions, including a predicted rise in temperatures of 5.4 degrees F (plus or minus 1.8 F) by the end of the century. This could lead to less rainfall and higher evaporation, especially in regions that are already dry. Other important effects include possible changes in El Ni\~no (climate variability) patterns and hurricane behaviors. Taking into account projected population growth, subsequent chapters explore likely trends with respect to water availability, coastal impacts, and biodiversity.The authors then look at the issues from a policy perspective, focusing on Texas\&\#39;s importance to the national economy as an energy producer, particularly of oil and gas. They recommend that Texas develop its own climate change policy to serve the goals of reducing greenhouse gas emissions, increasing energy independence, ensuring regional security, and improving management of water, air, land, and wildlife.},

Under full forcing, during the present warming period (PWP; 1901\textendash 1999), the Pacific SST shows a larger warming over the tropical Pacific region than the subtropical Pacific region. This pattern is composed of an El Ni\~no-like SST gradient (due to the greenhouse gas forcing) and a La Ni\~na-like SST gradient (due to natural forcing). Two sensitivity experiments, the PWP under greenhouse gas forcing and the medieval warming period (MWP; 751\textendash 1250) under natural forcing, were used to examine the mechanisms. The results showed that under the greenhouse gas forcing, the larger warming over the eastern tropical Pacific is induced by an increased surface net heat flux, which is mainly caused by short-wave radiation and long-wave radiation. Under natural forcing, a larger warming is induced over the western tropical Pacific by changes in the ocean vertical heat transportation, caused by surface wind anomalies.}

  abstract = {Climate resilience is increasingly prioritized by international development agencies and national governments. However, current approaches to informing communities of future climate risk are problematic. The predominant focus on end-of-century projections neglects more pressing development concerns, which relate to the management of shorter-term risks and climate variability, and constitutes a substantial opportunity cost for the limited financial and human resources available to tackle development challenges. When a long-term view genuinely is relevant to decision-making, much of the information available is not fit for purpose. Climate model projections are able to capture many aspects of the climate system and so can be relied upon to guide mitigation plans and broad adaptation strategies, but the use of these models to guide local, practical adaptation actions is unwarranted. Climate models are unable to represent future conditions at the degree of spatial, temporal, and probabilistic precision with which projections are often provided, which gives a false impression of confidence to users of climate change information. In this article, we outline these issues, review their history, and provide a set of practical steps for both the development and climate scientist communities to consider. Solutions to mobilize the best available science include a focus on decision-relevant timescales, an increased role for model evaluation and expert judgment and the integration of climate variability into climate change services.

  abstract = {Propagating uncertainties in flood damage models is a critical step towards a risk-informed decision methodology that is based on quantitative assessment. Flood-related data scarcity and the use of deterministic models present challenges when seeking to include uncertainties in flood damage modeling. In this paper, a single-variable and multi-variate component-based flood fragility method is proposed. The method uses expert-based data derived from online sources that are applied within a Monte Carlo framework to divide the building into independent components and then assigns these components to five predefined damage states that describe the building damage as a whole. Using a series of Monte Carlo simulations, uncertainties in flood depth and flood duration that result in each damage level for each component were propagated. Their damage is then characterized using component fragility functions to be used to develop total building fragility and loss functions. The resulting fragilities can be used as a probabilistic vulnerability function to be assigned to a real community based on building archetype and occupancy. The ability to develop flood fragility curves for buildings without the need for empirical field data is the primary contribution of this work.}

Results showed that September has the highest TC rainfall contribution and the coastal regions of North Carolina, Virginia, and Alabama receive more than 30\% of monthly rainfall totals from TCs.

The objectives of this study are to (1) assess temporal variability and trends in TC rainfall since 1960, and (2) characterize the spatial variability of TC rainfall during varying AMO and ENSO regimes. Kendall tau-b analysis highlighted the presence of statistically significant positive trends in TC rainfall at a number of locations. Principal components analysis revealed that AMO exhibited significant linkages to TC rainfall in northern New England as well as along the US Gulf Coast, while ENSO was most strongly linked to TC variability in Texas. Results illustrate the varied nature of TC rainfall across the eastern USA and the complex linkages to large-scale climate mechanisms at interannual and decadal time scales.}

  abstract = {Abstract This paper examines tropical cyclone (TC) rainfall in the eastern United States from the perspective of documenting accumulated annual water volumes and areas of the precipitation. Volume is a value that merges both rainfall depth and rainfall area into a single metric for each year that can be directly compared between individual years. Area represents the total land area affected by tropical rains. These TC rainfall metrics were then compared to the ENSO and the Atlantic multidecadal oscillation (AMO). Time series of annual TC water volumes show an annual average of 107 km3. The maximum volume was produced in 1985 with 405.8 km3, driven by Hurricanes Bob, Claudette, Danny, Elena, Gloria, Henri, Juan, and Kate as well as by Tropical Storms Henri and Isabel. The lowest TC volume occurred in 1978 with 8.9 km3. ENSO phases did not show any statistical correlation with TC frequency in the eastern United States. However, AMO showed a significant correlation with volume and the number of storms affecting the region. TC rainfall volume and area in the eastern United States showed a strong correlation. However, there are exceptions, whereby 1985 stands out as an exceptional volume year though the area affected is not as impressive. In contrast, 1979 is an example when TCs covered a large area with a corresponding small rainfall volume, in part because of the rapid forward movement of the storms, for example, Hurricanes David and Frederic. Since 1995, TCs have become more numerous, producing larger volumes and affecting larger areas.},

  abstract = {In the last twenty years, thousands of research papers covering different aspects of emerging contaminants have been published, ranging from environmental occurrence to treatment and ecological effects. Emerging contaminants are environmental pollutants that have been investigated widely only in the last two decades and include anthropogenic and naturally occurring chemicals such as pharmaceuticals and personal care products and their metabolites, illicit drugs, engineered nanomaterials, and antibiotic resistance genes. The advancement in our knowledge on emerging contaminants has been the result of the appearance of highly sensitive and powerful analytical instrumentation that rapidly developed, allowing identification and trace quantification of unknown contaminants in complex environmental matrices. High efficiency chromatographic separations coupled to high-resolution mass spectrometers have become more common in environmental laboratories and are the pillars of environmental research, increasing our awareness and understanding of the presence of emerging contaminants in the environment, their transformation and fate, and the complex ecological consequences that they pose on exposed biological systems. This introductory paper for the Virtual Thematic Issue on Emerging Contaminants presents a brief literature overview on key research milestones in the area of emerging contaminants, focusing on pharmaceuticals and personal care products and endocrine disrupting compounds, and highlighting selected research papers previously published in the Journal of Hazardous Materials during the period of January 2012 to December 2015.}

  abstract = {Many areas of the natural and social sciences involve complex systems that link together multiple sectors. Integrated assessment models (IAMs) are approaches that integrate knowledge from two or more domains into a single framework, and these are particularly important for climate change. One of the earliest IAMs for climate change was the DICE/RICE family of models, first published in Nordhaus (Science 258:1315\textendash 1319, 1992a), with the latest version in Nordhaus (2017, 2018). A difficulty in assessing IAMs is the inability to use standard statistical tests because of the lack of a probabilistic structure. In the absence of statistical tests, the present study examines the extent of revisions of the DICE model over its quarter-century history. The study finds that the major revisions have come primarily from the economic aspects of the model, whereas the environmental changes have been much smaller. Particularly, sharp revisions have occurred for global output, damages, and the social cost of carbon. These results indicate that the economic projections are the least precise parts of IAMs and deserve much greater study than has been the case up to now, especially careful studies of long-run economic growth (to 2100 and beyond). Additionally, the approach developed here can serve as a useful template for IAMs to describe their salient characteristics and revisions for the broader community of analysts.}

  abstract = {We develop a multiresolution model to predict two-dimensional spatial fields based on irregularly spaced observations. The radial basis functions at each level of resolution are constructed using a Wendland compactly supported correlation function with the nodes arranged on a rectangular grid. The grid at each finer level increases by a factor of two and the basis functions are scaled to have a constant overlap. The coefficients associated with the basis functions at each level of resolution are distributed according to a Gaussian Markov random field (GMRF) and take advantage of the fact that the basis is organized as a lattice. Several numerical examples and analytical results establish that this scheme gives a good approximation to standard covariance functions such as the Mat\'ern and also has flexibility to fit more complicated shapes. The other important feature of this model is that it can be applied to statistical inference for large spatial datasets because key matrices in the computations are sparse. The computational efficiency applies to both the evaluation of the likelihood and spatial predictions.}

  abstract = {AbstractEstimating design quantiles for extreme floods in river basins under nonstationary conditions is an emerging field. Nonstationarities could arise from a variety of human and natural factors such as urbanization and climate change. Concepts of return period, design quantile (return level), and risk have already been developed for situations in which increasing or decreasing trends and abrupt shifts in extreme events are present. Because of limited data records, sampling variability, model errors, and the errors in projections into the future, significant uncertainties in the estimates of design floods of future projects will arise. To address the issue of uncertainty resulting from limited sample size of the observations, three methods have been developed for computing confidence intervals for the design quantile corresponding to a desired return period under a nonstationary framework, including (a) delta, (b) bootstrap, and (c) profile likelihood methods. These methods have been developed assuming a generalized extreme value distribution with nonstationary parameters. The applicability and comparison of the proposed methods for determining the confidence interval of quantiles have been demonstrated by using the annual flood maxima of the Assunpink Creek in New Jersey. The delta method, with numerically derived local derivatives, and the approximate bootstrap can be computationally efficient. The profile likelihood method, which is known to be more accurate, is quite burdensome computationally but provides more realistic asymmetric confidence intervals.}

  abstract = {The concepts and methods for planning and design of hydraulic structures subject to hydrologic extreme events that arise from nonstationary conditions have emerged in the last few years. The traditional approaches such as return period, risk, and reliability assume that extreme events are stationary and they are being reformulated for applications under nonstationary conditions. For this purpose, some of the previous developments have been based on the nonhomogeneous geometric distribution. The particular importance of this paper relates to the frequency of extreme events as time evolves, say for a given time period n. For stationary extreme events, the number of events exceeding the design quantity (e.g., design flood) over the design life of the project, say n, can be determined from the binomial distribution. The main objective of the research reported in this paper is to develop a conceptual framework so that the frequency of extreme events when the extremes are nonstationary can be determined from the Poisson binomial distribution. In addition, the use of the number of extreme events in the future as an alternative metric for hydrologic design is proposed with potential applications in flooding associated with both riverine and sea level extremes in coastal regions. The application of analytical concepts is demonstrated by using the annual flood maxima of the Assunpink Creek in New Jersey. Results suggest that the frequency of extreme events as an alternative metric for hydrologic design has a significant potential for applications in risk-based economic analysis of projects.}

  abstract = {Emanating from his remarkable characterization of long-term variability in geophysical records in the early 1950s, Hurst's scientific legacy to hydrology and other disciplines is explored. A statistical explanation of the so-called ``Hurst Phenomenon'' did not emerge until 1968 when Mandelbrot and co-authors proposed fractional Gaussian noise based on the hypothesis of infinite memory. A vibrant hydrological literature ensued where alternative modelling representations were explored and debated, e.g. ARMA models, the Broken Line model, shifting mean models with no memory, FARIMA models, and Hurst-Kolmogorov dynamics, acknowledging a link with the work of Kolmogorov in 1940. The diffusion of Hurst's work beyond hydrology is summarized by discipline and citations, showing that he arguably has the largest scientific footprint of any hydrologist in the last century. Its particular relevance to the modelling of long-term climatic variability in the era of climate change is discussed. Links to various long-term modes of variability in the climate system, driven by fluctuations in sea surface temperatures and ocean dynamics, are explored. Several issues related to the Hurst Phenomenon in hydrology remain as a challenge for future research.Editor M. Acreman; Associate editor A. Carsteanu}

  abstract = {Sea levels are rising in many areas around the world, posing risks to coastal communities and infrastructures. Strategies for managing these flood risks present decision challenges that require a combination of geophysical, economic, and infrastructure models. Previous studies have broken important new ground on the considerable tensions between the costs of upgrading infrastructure and the damages that could result from extreme flood events. However, many risk-based adaptation strategies remain silent on certain potentially important uncertainties, as well as the tradeoffs between competing objectives. Here, we implement and improve on a classic decision-analytical model (Van Dantzig 1956) to: (i) capture tradeoffs across conflicting stakeholder objectives, (ii) demonstrate the consequences of structural uncertainties in the sea-level rise and storm surge models, and (iii) identify the parametric uncertainties that most strongly influence each objective using global sensitivity analysis. We find that the flood adaptation model produces potentially myopic solutions when formulated using traditional mean-centric decision theory. Moving from a single-objective problem formulation to one with multiobjective tradeoffs dramatically expands the decision space, and highlights the need for compromise solutions to address stakeholder preferences. We find deep structural uncertainties that have large effects on the model outcome, with the storm surge parameters accounting for the greatest impacts. Global sensitivity analysis effectively identifies important parameter interactions that local methods overlook, and that could have critical implications for flood adaptation strategies.},

  abstract = {Under high variable renewable energy (VRE) penetration, the occurrence of low VRE production, such as dark doldrums (Dunkelflaute) and wind-solar drought, can threaten a secure and continuous energy supply owing to an imbalance between electricity demand and supply. In this study, historically reconstructed long-term VRE generation and electricity demand were used to investigate the relationship between extremely high residual load (demand minus VRE output) and weather/climate in Japan. The impact of changes in the VRE's installed capacity on this relationship was also investigated using three simple future target scenarios. The results showed that the increase in installed VRE capacity causes greater daily and weekly residual load variabilities and affects the seasonality of its peaks. To study the weather patterns associated with high residual load events, self-organizing maps were applied to atmospheric circulation fields derived from atmospheric reanalysis data. The high residual load was associated with enhanced cold surge-type weather patterns during winter at the current low VRE installation level. However, under future increased VRE penetration, the weather patterns leading to high residual load will change to cloudy-windless types typically caused by a southern coastal extratropical cyclone. There is also considerable interannual variability in the frequency of high residual load events, which changed significantly with increasing VRE capacity.

  abstract = {Urban Climates is the first full synthesis of modern scientific and applied research on urban climates. The book begins with an outline of what constitutes an urban ecosystem. It develops a comprehensive terminology for the subject using scale and surface classification as key constructs. It explains the physical principles governing the creation of distinct urban climates, such as airflow around buildings, the heat island, precipitation modification and air pollution, and it then illustrates how this knowledge can be applied to moderate the undesirable consequences of urban development and help create more sustainable and resilient cities. With urban climate science now a fully-fledged field, this timely book fulfills the need to bring together the disparate parts of climate research on cities into a coherent framework. It is an ideal resource for students and researchers in fields such as climatology, urban hydrology, air quality, environmental engineering and urban design.},

  abstract = {The strong two-day cold wave in the midwestern United States in January 2019 again ignited the discussion as to whether cold waves are getting more severe or not as a result of Arctic amplification due to climate change. Assessing the evolution of cold waves in the northern hemisphere midlatitudes in the observations has been difficult because the variability of cold waves is large compared to anthropogenic warming. In order to detect changes in cold spells, two complementary ways to optimise the signal-to-noise ratio are employed: multi-decadal series at individual stations, and for shorter time periods by using spatially aggregated measures. Global warming is now strong enough to make trends clear at individual stations when considering long enough ({$>$}50 yr) records of daily minimum and maximum temperature. Calculating the land area that has temperatures below the 1-in-10 year return value (defined over 1951\textendash 1980) enables us to investigate trends over a shorter time horizon. The long-term station data have strong decreases everywhere in the lowest minimum temperature. Warming trends in the lowest maximum temperature are smaller over most of the Northern Hemisphere, with dataset-dependent indications of possible negative trends in parts of the United States and Mexico. Considering the area experiencing cold waves over the last decades, the most notable feature is a sharp decline of this area since the 1980s. The natural variability is still so large that it is possible to arbitrarily select starting dates after the decline for which the trend is slightly positive in smaller regions like North America or Europe. However, these values are within uncertainties compatible with a steady decline and have differing starting dates in North America and Europe. An analysis of the entire northern midlatitudes confirms the steady decrease in severity and frequency of cold waves over the last decades in the observations.}

  abstract = {Continued urbanization has led to tremendous changes on the landscape. These changes have exacerbated the effects of extreme climatic events such as flooding because of constrained water infiltration and increased surface flow. Typical runoff control measures involve sophisticated gray infrastructure that guide excess surface flow into storage and disposal sites. In a dynamic climate system, these measures are not sustainable since they cannot be easily modified to accommodate large volumes of runoff. Green Infrastructure (GI) is an adaptable technique that can be used to minimize runoff, in addition to offering an array of additional benefits (urban heat regulation, aesthetics, improved air quality etc.). Strategic placement of GI is key to achieving maximum utility. While physical site characteristics play a major role in determining suitable GI placement sites, knowledge of future precipitation patterns is crucial to ensure successful flood mitigation. In this paper, suitable GI sites within the city of Knoxville, Tennessee, were determined based on potential impact of an extreme flood event as indicated by site characteristics. Then, the relative potential likelihood of a flood event was determined based on projected precipitation data and knowledge of existing flood zones. By combining potential impact with likelihood information, low, medium, and high priority GI implementation sites were established. Results indicate that high priority sites are in the central parts of the city with priority decreasing outward. The GI prioritization scheme presented here, offers valuable guidance to city planners and policy makers who wish to exploit the GI approach for flood mitigation.}

The climate change research community is developing new scenarios integrating future changes in climate and society to investigate climate impacts as well as options for mitigation and adaptation. One component of these new scenarios is a set of alternative futures of societal development known as the shared socioeconomic pathways (SSPs). The conceptual framework for the design and use of the SSPs calls for the development of global pathways describing the future evolution of key aspects of society that would together imply a range of challenges for mitigating and adapting to climate change. Here we present one component of these pathways: the SSP narratives, a set of five qualitative descriptions of future changes in demographics, human development, economy and lifestyle, policies and institutions, technology, and environment and natural resources. We describe the methods used to develop the narratives as well as how these pathways are hypothesized to produce particular combinations of challenges to mitigation and adaptation. Development of the narratives drew on expert opinion to (1) identify key determinants of these challenges that were essential to incorporate in the narratives and (2) combine these elements in the narratives in a manner consistent with scholarship on their inter-relationships. The narratives are intended as a description of plausible future conditions at the level of large world regions that can serve as a basis for integrated scenarios of emissions and land use, as well as climate impact, adaptation and vulnerability analyses.}

We simulate negative learning in the context of climate change with a formal model that embeds the concept within the Bayesian framework, illustrating that it may lead to errant decisions and large welfare losses to society. Based on these cases, we suggest approaches to scientific assessment and decision making that could mitigate the problem. Application of the tools of science history to the study of learning in global change, including critical examination of the assessment process to understand how judgments are made, could provide important insights on how to improve the flow of information to policy makers.}

  abstract = {We present a semi-Bayesian hierarchical modeling framework for conducting space\textendash time frequency analysis of precipitation extremes over a large domain. In this framework, the data layer, the precipitation extreme \textendash{} i.e., seasonal maximum precipitation, at each station in each year is modeled using a generalized extreme value (GEV) distribution with temporally varying parameters, which are decomposed as linear functions of covariates. The coefficients of the covariates are estimated via maximum likelihood (ML). In the process layer, the estimated ML coefficients of each of the covariates across the stations are spatially modeled with a Gaussian multivariate process which enables capturing the spatial structure and correlation between the spatial model parameters. Suitable priors are used for the spatial model hyperparameters to complete the Bayesian formulation. Since the Bayesian formulation is only at the second level, our model is semi-Bayesian and thus, the posteriors are conditional posterior distributions. With the conditional posterior distribution of spatial fields of the GEV parameters for each time, conditional posterior distribution of the nonstationary space\textendash time return levels of the precipitation extremes are obtained. We demonstrate this framework by application to summer precipitation extreme at 73 stations covering a large domain of Southwest US consisting of Arizona, New Mexico, Colorado, and Utah. The results from fitting and cross-validation indicate that our model captures the historical variability at the stations very well. Conditional posterior distributions of return levels are simulated on a grid over the domain, which will be of immense utility in management of natural resources and infrastructure.}

With the growing share of wind and solar power in the European power system and their strong weather dependence, balancing the energy demand and supply becomes a great challenge. We characterize energy compound events, defined as periods of simultaneous low renewable production of wind and solar power, and high electricity demand. Using a logistic regression approach, we examine the influence of meteorological and atmospheric drivers on energy compound events. Moreover, we assess the spatial coherence of energy compound events that pose a major challenge within an interconnected power grid, as they can affect multiple countries simultaneously. On average, European countries are exposed to winter energy compound events more than twice per year. The combination of extremely low temperatures and low wind speeds is associated with a higher probability of occurrence of energy compound events. Furthermore, we show that blocked weather regimes have a major influence on energy compound events. In particular, Greenland and European blocking lead to widespread energy compound events that affect multiple countries at the same time. Our results highlight the relevance of weather regimes resulting in synchronous spatial energy compound events, which might pose a greater risk within a potential fully interconnected European grid. \textcopyright{} 2022 The Authors.

After testing that the precipitation deficit is the primary driver behind the reduced surface water availability, we undertake a multi-method attribution analysis for the meteorological drought, defined in terms of a deficit in the 3 years running mean precipitation averaged over the Western Cape area. The exact estimate of the return time of the event is sensitive to the number of stations whose data is incorporated in the analysis but the rarity of the event is unquestionable, with a return time of more than a hundred years. Synthesising the results from five different large model ensembles as well as observed data gives a significant increase by a factor of three (95\% confidence interval 1.5\textendash 6) of such a drought to occur because of anthropogenic climate change. All the model results further suggest that this trend will continue with future global warming. These results are in line with physical understanding of the effect of climate change at these latitudes and highlights that measures to improve Cape Town's resilience to future droughts are an adaptation priority.}

This paper performs a granular assessment of coastal flood risk in the mortgage market by using physical simulations of hurricane storm surge heights instead of using FEMA's flood insurance maps. Matching neighborhood-level predicted storm surge heights with mortgage files suggests that coastal flood risk may be large: originations and securitizations in storm surge areas have been rising sharply since 2012, while they remain stable when using flood insurance maps. Every year, more than 50 billion dollars of originations occur in storm surge areas outside of insurance floodplains. The share of agency mortgages increases in storm surge areas, yet remains stable in the flood insurance 100-year floodplain. Mortgages in storm surge areas are more likely to be complex: non-fully amortizing features such as interest-only or adjustable rates. Households may also be more vulnerable in storm surge areas: median household income is lower, the share of African Americans and Hispanics is substantially higher, the share of individuals with health coverage is lower. Price-to-rent ratios are declining in storm surge areas while they are increasing in flood insurance areas. This paper suggests that uncovering future financial flood risk requires scientific models that are independent of the flood insurance mapping process.},

In particular climate change and the concomitant increase of extreme weather events has exposed the inability of current governance regimes to deal with present and future challenges. Still our knowledge about resource governance regimes and how they change is quite limited. This paper develops a conceptual framework addressing the dynamics and adaptive capacity of resource governance regimes as multi-level learning processes. The influence of formal and informal institutions, the role of state and non-state actors, the nature of multi-level interactions and the relative importance of bureaucratic hierarchies, markets and networks are identified as major structural characteristics of governance regimes. Change is conceptualized as social and societal learning that proceeds in a stepwise fashion moving from single to double to triple loop learning. Informal networks are considered to play a crucial role in such learning processes. The framework supports flexible and context sensitive analysis without being case study specific. First empirical evidence from water governance supports the assumptions made on the dynamics of governance regimes and the usefulness of the chosen approach. More complex and diverse governance regimes have a higher adaptive capacity. However, it is still an open question how to overcome the state of single-loop learning that seem to characterize many attempts to adapt to climate change. Only further development and application of shared conceptual frameworks taking into account the real complexity of governance regimes can generate the knowledge base needed to advance current understanding to a state that allows giving meaningful policy advice.}

  abstract = {Urbanization is one of the main drivers of surface water loss, which implies a transition from water to land. However, it is still unclear how urban areas affect the spatial pattern of surface water loss. Here, we use remotely sensed data to analyze and model the decrease of surface water extent and, in particular, the frequency of surface water loss as a function of distance from urban areas across the contiguous United States (CONUS). We employ an exponential distance-decay model that confirms the presence of a higher frequency of surface water loss in the proximity of human settlements and provides innovative insights on surface water loss patterns at different spatial scales (i.e., river basins, water resource regions, and the CONUS). These spatial patterns are found to be influenced by climatic conditions, with more widely distributed losses in arid regions with respect to temperate and continental climates. Our results provide a new and deeper understanding of the spatial influence of urban areas on surface water loss, which could be effectively integrated in the definition of sustainable strategies for urbanization, water management, and surface water restoration, focused on both human and environmental water needs.}

  abstract = {Increases in extreme precipitation greater than in the mean under increased greenhouse gases have been reported in many climate models both on global and regional scales. It has been proposed in a previous study that whereas global-mean precipitation change is primarily constrained by the global energy budget, the heaviest events can be expected when effectively all the moisture in a volume of air is precipitated out, suggesting the intensity of these events increases with availability of moisture, and significantly faster than the global mean. Thus under conditions of constant relative humidity one might expect the Clausius\textendash Clapeyron relation to give a constraint on changes in the uppermost quantiles of precipitation distributions. This study examines if the phenomenon manifests on regional and seasonal scales also. Zonal analysis of daily precipitation in the HadCM3 model under a transient CO2 forcing scenario shows increased extreme precipitation in the tropics accompanied by increased drying at lower percentiles. At mid- to high-latitudes there is increased precipitation over all percentiles. The greatest agreement with Clausius\textendash Clapeyron predicted change occurs at mid-latitudes. This pattern is consistent with other climate model projections, and suggests that regions in which the nature of the ambient flows change little give the greatest agreement with Clausius\textendash Clapeyron prediction. This is borne out by repeating the analyses at gridbox level and over season. Furthermore, it is found that Clausius\textendash Clapeyron predicted change in extreme precipitation is a better predictor than directly using the change in mean precipitation, particularly between 60\textdegree N and 60\textdegree S. This could explain why extreme precipitation changes may be more detectable then mean changes.}

The main application is toward anthropogenic climate change, considered as the response of D to a small-amplitude imposed forcing f. The primary features of this perspective can be summarized as follows. First, the response to f will be manifest primarily in terms of changes to the residence frequency associated with the quasi-stationary regimes. Second, the geographical structures of these regimes will be relatively insensitive to f. Third, the large-scale signal will be most strongly influenced by f in rather localized regions of space and time. In this perspective, the signal arising from f will be strongly dependent of Ds natural variability. A theoretical framework for the perspective is developed based on a singular vector decomposition of Ds tangent propagator. Evidence for the dyamical perspective ...}

  abstract = {One of the most societally important manifestations of climate change is the changing frequency and amplitude of extreme weather and climate events. A simple conceptual picture of why climate change may lead to an increase in weather extremes is that as the atmosphere warms, the specific humidity of the air increases, and in regions of enhanced latent heat release circulation patterns become more intense. Such arguments, although relevant, are primarily thermodynamic in nature; the effect on the dynamics of the climate system is secondary. However, those with a background in climate dynamics have little doubt that dynamical considerations will play as important a role in our understanding of climate change as the simpler thermodynamic arguments. Unfortunately, our understanding of the dynamical processes that influence such extremes is currently rather poor. The report by Petoukhov et al. (1), aims at understanding how recent extreme events such as the heat waves in Europe in 2003, Russia in 2010, and North America in 2011, provide a hint at the primacy of dynamics in understanding future changes in weather and climate extremes. The focus of Petoukhov et al.s (1) study is the midlatitude atmospheric Rossby wave (e.g., ref. 2). Such atmospheric Rossby waves can be thought of as describing planetary-scale oscillations in the latitude of the jet stream: the ``river'' of fast moving air that circumnavigates the planet in the upper troposphere in the \ldots{} [{$\carriagereturn$}][1]1E-mail: t.n.palmeratatm.ox.ac.uk.

Combining the projections with observed tide gauge records, we explore the contribution to total variance that arises from sea-level variability, different emissions scenarios, and model uncertainty. For the period out to 2300 we further breakdown the model uncertainty by sea-level component and consider the dependence on geographic location, time horizon, and emissions scenario. Our analysis highlights the importance of local variability for sea-level change in the coming decades and the potential value of annual-to-decadal predictions of local sea-level change. Projections to 2300 show a substantial degree of committed sea-level rise under all emissions scenarios considered and highlight the reduced future risk associated with RCP2.6 and RCP4.5 compared to RCP8.5. Tide gauge locations can show large ( {$>$} 50\%) departures from the global average, in some cases even reversing the sign of the change. While uncertainty in projections of the future Antarctic ice dynamic response tends to dominate post-2100, we see substantial differences in the breakdown of model variance as a function of location, time scale, and emissions scenario.},

  abstract = {The generalized extreme value (GEV) distribution is often fitted to environmental time series of extreme values such as annual maxima of daily precipitation. We study two methodological issues here. First, we compare criteria for selecting the best model among 16 GEV models that allow nonstationary scale and location parameters. Simulation results showed that both the corrected Akaike information criterion and Bayesian information criterion (BIC) always detected nonstationarity, but the BIC selected the correct model more often except in very small samples. Second, we examined confidence intervals (CIs) for model parameters and other quantities such as the return levels that are usually required for hydrological and climatological time series. Four bootstrap CIs\textemdash normal, percentile, basic and bias-corrected and accelerated\textemdash constructed by random-t resampling, fixed-t resampling and the parametric bootstrap methods were compared. CIs for parameters of the stationary model do not present major differences. CIs for the more extreme quantiles tend to become very wide for all bootstrap methods. For nonstationary GEV models with linear time dependence of location or log-linear time dependence of scale, CI coverage probabilities are reasonably accurate for the parameters. For the extreme percentiles, the bias-corrected and accelerated method is best overall, and the fixed-t method also has good average coverage probabilities. A case study is presented of annual maximum daily precipitation over the mountainous Mesochora catchment in Greece. Analysis of historical data and data generated under two climate scenarios (control run and climate change) supported a stationary GEV model reducing to the Gumbel distribution.

The FAS is a flood modeling and alert system that leverages state of the art flood modeling and rainfall radar data in an efficient manner. The ACF model comprises of a road network of the study area, census data, locations of critical facilities like hospitals and fire stations, and a spatial and network analysis toolbox written in Python. The proposed framework can be used to evaluate, in near real-time, system level performance such as accessibility to critical locations and component level performance such as potential impacts on roadways. As a proof of concept, the coupled framework is applied to the White Oak Bayou watershed, Houston, Texas. First, the hydrologic and hydraulic characteristics of the watershed are captured through inundation maps forming a floodplain map library (FPML). Second, five accessibility measures quantifying mobility and accessibility are evaluated for each inundation map to develop the accessibility map library (AML). During a storm event, real-time radar rainfall data is used to identify the pertinent scenario from the FPML and AML. The selected maps are then communicated to stakeholders to support emergency response and situational awareness. Further, the results from the framework can also be used for disaster mitigation planning. Although demonstrated on a single watershed, the methodology developed in this study is transferrable to other regions to develop an integrated flood alert system in support of emergency response and longer-term resilience goals.}

  abstract = {Severe storms and associated flooding pose a significant risk to urban mobility. Consequently, 40 to 63\% of flood-related deaths are linked to roadway-related incidents in developed countries. The dynamic nature of flooding and the lack of real-time information make it challenging to sense flooding and its impact on roadways. Hence, existing stateof-the-art methods fall short of providing a robust, reliable, and affordable tool to facilitate situational awareness during storms. Such a tool is indispensable to aid emergency response, especially considering the potential increase in risk to flood exposure due to climate change and other factors. This study addresses this need by providing an open-source framework that couples real-time rainfall data, a physics-based flood model, and network and spatial analyses to sense real-time flood impact on the road transportation system. Case studies using four recent storms in Houston, Texas demonstrate the framework's ability to provide vehicle-class specific roadway conditions for even minor roads and residential streets\textemdash a problem existing approaches struggle with. Aside from road-link conditions, the framework can also estimate network-level flood impacts, such as identifying regions without access to critical facilities like hospitals, giving decision-makers a more holistic view of network performance. Further, the framework is interoperable with existing intelligent transportation systems and could augment their ability to sense road conditions during flooding. Finally, the proposed framework can equip flood-prone communities and emergency responders with reliable and accessible situational awareness content using open-source tools and data to promote safer mobility during flooding\textemdash a key goal of intelligent transportation systems.}

However, while existing stochastic simulation methods are mature enough to deal with relatively small domains and coarse spatiotemporal scales, additional work is required to develop simulation tools for large-domain analyses, which are more and more common in an increasingly interconnected world. This study proposes a methodological advancement in the CoSMoS framework, which is a flexible simulation framework preserving arbitrary marginal distributions and correlations, to dramatically decrease the computational burden and make the algorithm fast enough to perform large-domain simulations in short time. The proposed approach focuses on correlated processes with mixed (zero-inflated) Uniform marginal distributions. These correlated processes act as intermediates between the target process to simulate (precipitation) and parent Gaussian processes that are the core of the simulation algorithm. Working in the mixed-Uniform space enables a substantial simplification of the so-called correlation transformation functions, which represent a computational bottle neck in the original CoSMoS formulation. As a proof of concept, we simulate 40 years of daily precipitation records from 1,000 gauging stations in the Mississippi River basin. Moreover, we extend CoSMoS incorporating parent non-Gaussian processes with different degrees of tail dependence and suggest potential improvements including the separate simulation of occurrence and intensity processes, and the use of advection, anisotropy, and nonstationary spatiotemporal correlation functions.}

In Europe, several flood events of this type have been recorded in the past century in Belgium, France, Ireland, Italy and United Kingdom. Here, we investigate the probability of joint occurrence of storm surges, precipitation, river discharges and waves. A coincidence of those factors have a potential to cause compound floods. We use several datasets covering most of Europe, including observations and data from the European Flood Awareness System (EFAS), ERA-Interim climate reanalysis and a regional climate model within the CORDEX framework, and carry out a statistical analysis based on copulas to assess the likelihood of joint occurrence. Further, we synthesize the joint probability of occurrence of extreme compound events, and their intensity, in the form of a composite index, thus identifying areas where compound floods could be of most concern. The results show considerable regional differences in dependency structure and the resulting joint probability of extreme surge, precipitation and river discharge events. In southern Europe the probability of joint occurrence of storm surge and precipitation is relatively high due to significant flash flood hazard. In northern Europe, along the main corridor of winter storms, dependency between surges and river discharges is higher than elsewhere, with large differences between west-facing and east-facing coasts. The occurrence of compound floods in most of the Nordic countries and along the Black Sea is very unlikely. The results allow the identification of areas at risk from compound flooding. Future studies that utilize statistical and physical methods are recommended to assess interactions between surges and inland runoff at a local scale.{$<$}/p{$>$}}

However, network reliability problems are known to be \#P-complete, a computational complexity class believed to be intractable, and thus motivate the quest for approximations. Based on their theoretical foundations, reliability evaluation methods can be grouped as: (i) exact or bounds, (ii) guarantee-less sampling, and (iii) probably approximately correct (PAC). Group (i) is well regarded due to its useful byproducts, but it does not scale in practice. Group (ii) scales well and verifies desirable properties, such as the bounded relative error, but it lacks error guarantees. Group (iii) is of great interest when precision and scalability are required. We introduce K-RelNet, an extended counting-based method that delivers PAC guarantees for the K-terminal reliability problem. We also put our developments in context relative to classical and emerging techniques to facilitate dissemination. Then, we test in a fair way the performance of competitive methods using various benchmark systems. We note the range of application of algorithms and suggest a foundation for future computational reliability and resilience engineering, given the need for principled uncertainty quantification across complex networked systems.}

We will stay here in a fully probabilistic setting. A common problem is how to account for epistemic uncertainty tainting the parameter of the probability distribution of the inputs. In the standard practice, this uncertainty is often neglected (plug-in approach). When a specific uncertainty assessment is made, under the basis of the available information (expertise and/or data), a common solution consists in marginalizing the joint distribution of both observable inputs and parameters of the probabilistic model (i.e. computing the predictive pdf of the inputs), then propagating it through the deterministic model. We will reinterpret this approach in the light of Bayesian decision theory, and will put into evidence that this practice leads the analyst to adopt implicitly a specific loss function which may be inappropriate for the problem under investigation, and suboptimal from a decisional perspective. These concepts are illustrated on a simple numerical example, concerning a case of flood risk assessment.}

Because an in-depth treatment of uncertainties can be complex and costly, this paper then discusses when and why a full (two-tier) uncertainty analysis is justified. In the treatment of epistemic uncertainty, an unavoidable and difficult problem is the encoding of probability distributions based on scientific evidence and expert judgments. The last sections include a description of different approaches to the aggregation of expert opinions and their use in risk analysis, and a recent example of methodology and application (in seismic hazard analysis) that can be transferred to other domains.}

  abstract = {FourCastNet, short for Fourier Forecasting Neural Network, is a global data-driven weather forecasting model that provides accurate short to medium-range global predictions at \$0.25\^\{\textbackslash circ\}\$ resolution. FourCastNet accurately forecasts high-resolution, fast-timescale variables such as the surface wind speed, precipitation, and atmospheric water vapor. It has important implications for planning wind energy resources, predicting extreme weather events such as tropical cyclones, extra-tropical cyclones, and atmospheric rivers. FourCastNet matches the forecasting accuracy of the ECMWF Integrated Forecasting System (IFS), a state-of-the-art Numerical Weather Prediction (NWP) model, at short lead times for large-scale variables, while outperforming IFS for variables with complex fine-scale structure, including precipitation. FourCastNet generates a week-long forecast in less than 2 seconds, orders of magnitude faster than IFS. The speed of FourCastNet enables the creation of rapid and inexpensive large-ensemble forecasts with thousands of ensemble-members for improving probabilistic forecasting. We discuss how data-driven deep learning models such as FourCastNet are a valuable addition to the meteorology toolkit to aid and augment NWP models.},

Models using index-based climate predictors and gridded fields of large-scale circulation as predictors are utilized. Logistic regression (LR) and fully connected neural networks using indices of climate phenomena as predictors produce neither accurate nor reliable predictions, indicating that the indices themselves are not good predictors. Using gridded fields as predictors, a LR and convolutional neural network (CNN) are more accurate than the index based models. However, only the CNN can produce reliable predictions which can be used to identify forecasts of opportunity. Using explainable machine learning we identify which variables and gridpoints of the input fields are most relevant for confident and correct predictions in the CNN. Our results show that the local circulation is most important as represented by maximum relevance of 850 hPa geopotential heights and zonal winds to making skillful, high probability predictions. Corresponding composite anomalies identify connections with the El-Ni\~no Southern Oscillation during winter and the Atlantic Multidecadal Oscillation and North Atlantic Subtropical High during summer.},

The model combines physical and stochastic approaches to simulate key meteorological variables at high spatial and temporal resolution: 2 km \texttimes{} 2 km and 5 min for precipitation and cloud cover and 100 m \texttimes{} 100 m and 1 h for near-surface air temperature, solar radiation, vapor pressure, atmospheric pressure, and near-surface wind. The model requires spatially distributed data for the calibration process, which can nowadays be obtained by remote sensing devices (weather radar and satellites), reanalysis data sets and ground stations. AWE-GEN-2d is parsimonious in terms of computational demand and therefore is particularly suitable for studies where exploring internal climatic variability at multiple spatial and temporal scales is fundamental. Applications of the model include models of environmental systems, such as hydrological and geomorphological models, where high-resolution spatial and temporal meteorological forcing is crucial. The weather generator was calibrated and validated for the Engelberg region, an area with complex topography in the Swiss Alps. Model test shows that the climate variables are generated by AWE-GEN-2d with a level of accuracy that is sufficient for many practical applications.},

What is not appreciated is just how asymmetric this distribution is in time, and the even more asymmetric nature of trends due to climate change. We diagnose the temporal asymmetry in models and observations. Half of annual precipitation falls in the wettest 12 days each year in the median across observing stations worldwide. Climate models project changes in precipitation that are more uneven than present-day precipitation. In a scenario with high greenhouse-gas emissions, one-fifth of the projected increase in rain falls in the wettest two days of the year, and seventy percent in the wettest two weeks. Adjusting modeled unevenness to match present-day unevenness at stations, half of precipitation increase occurs in the wettest 6 days each year.},

In this paper we argue that Information Physics reconciles and generalizes statistical, geometric, and mechanistic views on information. We start by demonstrating how the use and interpretation of Entropy and Information coincide in Information Theory, Statistical Thermodynamics, and Analytical Mechanics, and how this can be taken advantage of when addressing Earth Science problems in general and hydrological problems in particular. In the second part we discuss how Information Physics provides ways to quantify Information and Entropy from fundamental physical principles. This extends their use to cases where the preconditions to calculate Entropy in the classical manner as an aggregate statistical measure are not met. Indeed, these preconditions are rarely met in the Earth Sciences due either to limited observations or the far-from-equilibrium nature of evolving systems. Information Physics therefore offers new opportunities for improving the treatment of Earth Science problems.},

The specific potential impact of extreme events on energy systems has been difficult to quantify due to the unpredictability of future weather events. Here we develop a stochastic-robust optimization method to consider both low impact variations and extreme events. Applications of the method to 30 cities in Sweden, by considering 13 climate change scenarios, reveal that uncertainties in renewable energy potential and demand can lead to a significant performance gap (up to 34\% for grid integration) brought by future climate variations and a drop in power supply reliability (up to 16\%) due to extreme weather events. Appropriate quantification of the climate change impacts will ensure robust operation of the energy systems and enable renewable energy penetration above 30\% for a majority of the cities.},

Here, we propose a common mechanism for the generation of persistent longitudinal planetary-scale high-amplitude patterns of the atmospheric circulation in the Northern Hemisphere midlatitudes. Those patternswith zonal wave numbers m = 6, 7, or 8are characteristic of the above extremes. We show that these patterns might result from trapping within midlatitude waveguides of free synoptic waves with zonal wave numbers k {$\approx$} m. Usually, the quasistationary dynamical response with the above wave numbers m to climatological mean thermal and orographic forcing is weak. Such midlatitude waveguides, however, may favor a strong magnification of that response through quasiresonance.}

We further show that resonance conditions for these planetary waves were, in many cases, present before the onset of high-amplitude wave events, with a lead time up to 2 wk, suggesting that quasiresonant amplification (QRA) of these waves had occurred.

  abstract = {Mesh-based simulations are central to modeling complex physical systems in many disciplines across science and engineering. Mesh representations support powerful numerical integration methods and their resolution can be adapted to strike favorable trade-offs between accuracy and efficiency. However, high-dimensional scientific simulations are very expensive to run, and solvers and parameters must often be tuned individually to each system studied. Here we introduce MeshGraphNets, a framework for learning mesh-based simulations using graph neural networks. Our model can be trained to pass messages on a mesh graph and to adapt the mesh discretization during forward simulation. Our results show it can accurately predict the dynamics of a wide range of physical systems, including aerodynamics, structural mechanics, and cloth. The model's adaptivity supports learning resolution-independent dynamics and can scale to more complex state spaces at test time. Our method is also highly efficient, running 1-2 orders of magnitude faster than the simulation on which it is trained. Our approach broadens the range of problems on which neural network simulators can operate and promises to improve the efficiency of complex, scientific modeling tasks.},

  abstract = {We design, apply, and validate a methodology for correcting climate model output to produce internally consistent fields that have the same statistical intensity distribution as the observations. We refer to this as a statistical bias correction. Validation of the methodology is carried out using daily precipitation fields, defined over Europe, from the ENSEMBLES climate model dataset. The bias correction is calculated using data from 1961 to 1970, without distinguishing between seasons, and applied to seasonal data from 1991 to 2000. This choice of time periods is made to maximize the lag between calibration and validation within the ERA40 reanalysis period. Results show that the method performs unexpectedly well. Not only are the mean and other moments of the intensity distribution improved, as expected, but so are a drought and a heavy precipitation index, which depend on the autocorrelation spectra. Given that the corrections were derived without seasonal distinction and are based solely on intensity distributions, a statistical quantity oblivious of temporal correlations, it is encouraging to find that the improvements are present even when seasons and temporal statistics are considered. This encourages the application of this method to multi-decadal climate projections.}

However, little is known about how trade-offs between water quality and affordability implications of these consolidation efforts are experienced and perceived by residents. Here, we analyzed changes in water quality, affordability, and perception associated with a groundwater contamination-motivated transition from private well to regulated municipal water. We conducted water quality samplings and household surveys pre- and post-municipal service extension in the Town of Orleans, NY. Our findings illustrate that water quality improved due the connection to municipal service, resulting in increased consumption of tap water, improved perception of water quality and reliability, and decreased use of household treatment, but with a much higher monthly expenditure. Residents reported general satisfaction with their new municipal water service; however, the cost of service was more than expected, and some were dissatisfied with the taste of chlorine in the municipal supply. Despite the positive public health implications, it is important to consider the trade-offs in regulated water transitions and the perceptions of residents to foster successful, sustainable solutions.}

  abstract = {Global climate model (GCM) output typically needs to be bias corrected before it can be used for climate change impact studies. Three existing bias correction methods, and a new one developed here, are applied to daily maximum temperature and precipitation from 21 GCMs to investigate how different methods alter the climate change signal of the GCM. The quantile mapping (QM) and cumulative distribution function transform (CDF-t) bias correction methods can significantly alter the GCM's mean climate change signal, with differences of up to 2\textdegree C and 30\% points for monthly mean temperature and precipitation, respectively. Equidistant quantile matching (EDCDFm) bias correction preserves GCM changes in mean daily maximum temperature but not precipitation. An extension to EDCDFm termed PresRat is introduced, which generally preserves the GCM changes in mean precipitation. Another problem is that GCMs can have difficulty simulating variance as a function of frequency. To address this, a frequency-dependent bias correction method is introduced that is twice as effective as standard bias correction in reducing errors in the models' simulation of variance as a function of frequency, and it does so without making any locations worse, unlike standard bias correction. Last, a preconditioning technique is introduced that improves the simulation of the annual cycle while still allowing the bias correction to take account of an entire season's values at once.}

  abstract = {The goal of this paper is to compare several widely used Bayesian model selection methods in practical model selection problems, highlight their differences and give recommendations about the preferred approaches. We focus on the variable subset selection for regression and classification and perform several numerical experiments using both simulated and real world data. The results show that the optimization of a utility estimate such as the cross-validation (CV) score is liable to finding overfitted models due to relatively high variance in the utility estimates when the data is scarce. This can also lead to substantial selection induced bias and optimism in the performance evaluation for the selected model. From a predictive viewpoint, best results are obtained by accounting for model uncertainty by forming the full encompassing model, such as the Bayesian model averaging solution over the candidate models. If the encompassing model is too complex, it can be robustly simplified by the projection method, in which the information of the full model is projected onto the submodels. This approach is substantially less prone to overfitting than selection based on CV-score. Overall, the projection method appears to outperform also the maximum a posteriori model and the selection of the most probable variables. The study also demonstrates that the model selection can greatly benefit from using cross-validation outside the searching process both for guiding the model size selection and assessing the predictive performance of the finally selected model.

We argue that the previous default choices are dubious due to their tendency to favor solutions with more unshrunk coefficients than we typically expect a priori. This can lead to bad results if this parameter is not strongly identified by data. We derive the relationship between the global parameter and the effective number of nonzeros in the coefficient vector, and show an easy and intuitive way of setting up the prior for the global parameter based on our prior beliefs about the number of nonzero coefficients in the model. The results on real world data show that one can benefit greatly -- in terms of improved parameter estimates, prediction accuracy, and reduced computation time -- from transforming even a crude guess for the number of nonzero coefficients into the prior for the global parameter using our framework.},

Since 1993, there has been a widespread perception that the flood caused a fundamental shift in U.S. policies toward flood mitigation and floodplain management. New emphases on flood-damage prevention included widely publicized FEMA buyouts of floodplain properties. In Illinois and Missouri, 8700 properties were acquired at a cost of \$56.3 million, but these buyouts are now being massively counterbalanced by new construction on U.S. floodplains. The epicenter of this recent rush onto the floodplain is the St. Louis metropolitan region, with \$2.2 billion in new development on land that was under water in 1993. This Policy Forum describes the scale of floodplain encroachment across the United States, explores negative impacts of such encroachment, and outlines alternatives that have been proposed and implemented worldwide. {$<$}/p{$>$}},

In this study, we use multiobjective optimization to strategically incorporate green infrastructure (GI) into water resources management plans that maximize reductions in nutrient loads, minimize stormwater runoff, and minimize costs. Robust decision-making methods are applied to the resulting plan options to evaluate how optimized GI implementation varies under different possible future climates and to determine which solutions would be robust under a range of plausible future conditions. We demonstrate these coupled methods using a case study in southern Massachusetts to address water quality issues related to point and nonpoint source nutrients in a rapidly developing watershed.},

  abstract = {Efforts to assess risks to the financial system associated with climate change are growing. These commonly combine the use of Integrated Assessment Models to obtain possible changes in global mean temperature and then use coupled climate models to map those changes onto finer spatial scales to estimate changes in other variables. Other methods use data mined from ``ensembles of opportunity'' such as the Coupled Model Intercomparison Project. Several challenges with current approaches have been identified. Here, we focus on demonstrating the issues inherent in applying global `top-down' climate scenarios to explore financial risks at geographical scales of relevance to financial institutions (e.g. city-scale). We use data mined from the Coupled Model Intercomparison Project to determine the degree to which estimates of global mean temperature can be used to estimate changes in the annual extremes of temperature and rainfall, two compound events (heatwaves and drought, and extreme rain and strong winds), and whether the emission scenario provides insights into the change in the 20-, 50- and 100-year return values for temperature and rainfall. We show that global mean temperature provides little insight on how acute risks likely material to the financial sector (``material extremes'') will change at a city-scale. We conclude that ``top-down'' approaches are likely to be flawed when applied at a granular scale, and that there are risks in employing the approaches used by, for example, the Network of Central Banks and Supervisors for Greening the Financial System. Most fundamental, uncertainty associated with projections of future climate extremes must be propagated through to estimating risk. We strongly encourage a review of existing top-down approaches before they develop into de facto standards and note that existing approaches that use a ``bottom-up'' strategy (e.g., catastrophe modelling and storylines) are more likely to enable a robust assessment of material risk.}

  abstract = {Due to anthropological climate change, climate scientists project a significant change in climate in the coming years. Despite the advances in climate modeling, future climate is still subject to large uncertainties. To mitigate greenhouse gas emissions and slow down climate change, the energy system must undergo a fundamental transition. Thereby, energy system modeling tools are used to optimize the design of future energy systems. As many components of an energy system depend on climate variables, changing climate and its uncertainties influence the outcome of energy system models. Energy systems with high shares of renewable energies are thereby especially vulnerable to changing climate conditions. To find how the changing climate and its uncertainties are assessed in energy system modeling, a systematic literature review was conducted. Thereby we address three major issues: First, we depict the most common techniques to convert climate data into energy system input data. As large amounts of climate data are necessary to depict future climate developments, we secondly review data reduction techniques which can be used to restrain computational time. Around 46\% of the studies in this review use those techniques with scenario building being the most common one. Finally, we review methods to explicitly assess climate uncertainty in energy system models. The majority of energy system optimization models searches for individual solutions for the scenarios, while only 22\% use methods that include the uncertainty explicitly in the optimization process. We see the need for further research especially in the use of more advanced optimization methods and the combination of those with well known data reduction techniques. The review provides a wide synopsis of different methods for the three major issues and can therefore enable energy system modelers to choose the right methods for the specific challenges.}

Conserving biodiversity, while at the same time meeting expanding human needs, is an issue of utmost importance. In this paper we develop a spatially explicit landscape-level model for analyzing the biological and economic consequences of alternative land-use patterns. The spatially explicit biological model incorporates habitat preferences, area requirements and dispersal ability between habitat patches for terrestrial vertebrate species to predict the likely number of species that will be sustained on the landscape. The spatially explicit economic model incorporates site characteristics and location to predict economic returns for a variety of potential land uses. We apply the model to search for efficient land-use patterns that maximize biodiversity conservation objectives for given levels of economic returns, and vice versa. We apply the model to the Willamette Basin, Oregon, USA. By thinking carefully about the arrangement of activities, we find land-use patterns that sustain high levels of biodiversity and economic returns. Compared to the 1990 land-use pattern, we show that both biodiversity conservation and the value of economic activity could be increased substantially.}

  abstract = {Large-scale estimations of flood losses are often based on spatially aggregated inputs. This makes risk assessments vulnerable to aggregation bias, a well-studied, sometimes substantial outcome in analyses that model fine-grained spatial phenomena at coarse spatial units. To evaluate this potential in the context of large-scale flood risk assessments, we use data from a high-resolution flood hazard model and structure inventory for over 1.3 million properties in Massachusetts and examine how prominent data aggregation approaches affect the magnitude and spatial distribution of flood loss estimates. All considered aggregation approaches rely on aggregate structure inventories but differ in whether flood hazard is also aggregated. We find that aggregating only structure inventories slightly underestimates overall losses (-10\% bias), and when flood hazard data is spatially aggregated to even relatively small spatial units (census block), statewide aggregation bias can reach +366\%. All aggregation-based procedures fail to capture the spatial covariation of inputs distributions in the upper tails that disproportionately generate total expected losses. Our findings are robust to several key assumptions, add important context to published risk assessments and highlight opportunities to improve flood loss estimation uncertainty quantification.}

  abstract = {Deterministic simulation models are used in many areas of science, engineering, and policy making. Typically, these are complex models that attempt to capture underlying mechanisms in considerable detail, and they have many user-specified inputs. The inputs are often specified by some form of trial-and-error approach in which plausible values are postulated, the corresponding outputs inspected, and the inputs modified until plausible outputs are obtained. Here we address the issue of more formal inference for such models. A probabilistic approach, called Bayesian synthesis, was shown to suffer from the Borel paradox, according to which the results can depend on the parameterization of the model. We propose a modified approach, called Bayesian melding which takes into full account information and uncertainty about both inputs and outputs to the model, while avoiding the Borel paradox. This is done by recognizing the existence of two priors, one implicit and one explicit, on each input and output; these are combined via logarithmic pooling. Bayesian melding is then standard Bayesian inference with the pooled prior on inputs, and is implemented here by posterior simulation using the sampling-importance-resampling (SIR) algorithm. We develop this initially for invertible models, and then extend it to the more difficult and more common case of noninvertible models. We illustrate the methodology using a number of examples. Simulation studies show that the method outperforms a simpler Bayesian approach in terms of mean squared error. A number of open research problems are discussed.}

Accurate flood maps are critical to communicating flood risk to vulnerable populations, to mitigating and adapting to floods, and to the functioning of the federal flood insurance program. Yet, we know little about how the mapping process works in practice. This article argues that politics can shape the remapping process in ways that leave communities vulnerable. Because mapping takes place within the context of the National Flood Insurance Program, the conversation at the local level often centers on the costs of revising the flood hazard zones rather than the risks associated with flooding. This can lead to less than optimal responses by individuals and communities, and suggests that the USA is not adequately preparing for future climate change impacts.}

  abstract = {Accurately forecasting extreme rainfall is notoriously difficult, but is also ever more crucial for society as climate change increases the frequency of such extremes. Global numerical weather prediction models often fail to capture extremes, and are produced at too low a resolution to be actionable, while regional, high-resolution models are hugely expensive both in computation and labour. In this paper we explore the use of deep generative models to simultaneously correct and downscale (super-resolve) global ensemble forecasts over the Continental US. Specifically, using fine-grained radar observations as our ground truth, we train a conditional Generative Adversarial Network -- coined CorrectorGAN -- via a custom training procedure and augmented loss function, to produce ensembles of high-resolution, bias-corrected forecasts based on coarse, global precipitation forecasts in addition to other relevant meteorological fields. Our model outperforms an interpolation baseline, as well as super-resolution-only and CNN-based univariate methods, and approaches the performance of an operational regional high-resolution model across an array of established probabilistic metrics. Crucially, CorrectorGAN, once trained, produces predictions in seconds on a single machine. These results raise exciting questions about the necessity of regional models, and whether data-driven downscaling and correction methods can be transferred to data-poor regions that so far have had no access to high-resolution forecasts.},

We take as an example the range of sea level rise magnitudes for 2100 contained in the IPCC Third Assessment Report [Church, J.A., Gregory, J.M., Huybrechts, P., Kuhn, M., Lambeck, K., Nhuan, M.T., Qin, D., Woodworth, P.L., Anisimov, O.A., Bryan, F.O., Cazenave, A., Dixon, K.W., Fitzharris, B.B., Flato, G.M., Ganopolski, A., Gornitz, V., Lowe, J.A., Noda, A., Oberhuber, J.M., O'Farrell, S.P., Ohmura, A., Oppenheimer, M., Peltier, W.R., Raper, S.C.B., Ritz, C., Russell, G.L., Schlosser, E., Shum, C.K., Stocker, T.F., Stouffer, R.J., van de Wal, R.S.W., Voss, R., Wiebe, E.C., Wild, M., Wingham, D.J. and Zwally, H.J., 2001.

Contribution of Working Group I to the Third Assessment Report of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change. Cambridge University Press, Cambridge, United Kingdom, 881pp.] and infer a plausible probability distribution for this range. We then use a Monte Carlo procedure to sample from this distribution and use the resulting values as an additional boundary forcing for a two-dimensional model of coastal inundation used to simulate a 1 in 200~year extreme water level event. This yields an ensemble of simulations for an event of this magnitude occurring in 2100, where each member represents a different possible scenario of sea level rise by this time. We then develop a methodology to approximate the probability of flooding in each model grid cell over the ensemble and by combining these hazards maps with maps of land use values (consequence) we are able to estimate spatial contributions to flood risk that can aid planning and investment decisions. The method is then applied to a 32~km section of the UK coast in Somerset, South-West England and used to estimate the monetary losses and risk due a 1 in 200~year recurrence interval event under: (a) current conditions; (b) with the IPCC's most plausible value for sea level rise by 2100 (0.48~m) and (c) using the above methodology to fully account for uncertainty over possible sea level rise. The analysis shows that undertaking a risk assessment using the most plausible sea level rise value may significantly underestimate monetary losses as it fails to account for the impact of low probability, high consequence events. The developed method provides an objective basis for decisions regarding future defence spending and can be easily extended to consider other sources of uncertainty such as changing event frequency\textendash magnitude distribution, changing storm surge conditions or model structural uncertainty, either singly or in combination as joint probabilities.}

  abstract = {Flooding is one of the most frequent and disastrous natural hazards that can have catastrophic impacts on human society and urban infrastructure. Increasing the incidence of urban flooding highlights the need for reliable flood mitigation strategies that can effectively minimize losses owing to disasters. The strategic placement of flood mitigation measures is undoubtedly the key to achieving maximum effectiveness of flood reduction schemes. The physical characteristics of the site and knowledge of regional relevance play an important role in determining the location of appropriate flood mitigation measures. In the case of limited resources, it is crucial to prioritize areas for installation of flood mitigation measures. Therefore, an indicator-based method was developed in this study to identify and prioritize sites to concentrate limited resources where they are needed the most. Based on the source tracking method, a tracer-aided urban flood model was developed to study the impact of direct and indirect connections between urban systems, explore their relative importance in the network, and prioritize related risks to improve resource allocation efficiency. Longkungou drainage district of Haikou City was selected as the study area to determine the prioritization of catchments for flood mitigation. The results indicated that high prioritization sites are in the upstream of the urban areas with prioritization decreasing downstream, and the prioritization of interventions presents a spatial trend of ``high south and low north''. This study demonstrates the novelty of a tracer-aided urban flood model in flood management and highlights the spatial connectivity between flood source areas and flood hazard areas. The prioritization scheme of urban catchment flood mitigation measures proposed in this study provides valuable guidance for policy makers and urban planners who wish to exploit the approach for flood mitigation.}

  abstract = {Multireservoir systems are designed to serve multiple conflicting demands over varying time scales that may be out of phase with the system's hydroclimatic inputs. Adaptive, nonlinear reservoir control policies are often best suited to serve these needs. However, nonlinear operating policies are hard to interpret, so water managers tend to favor simple, static rules that may not effectively manage conflicts between the system's multisectoral demands. In this study, we introduce an analytical framework for opening the black box of optimized nonlinear operating policies, decomposing their time-varying information sensitivities to show how their adaptive and coordinated release prescriptions better manage hydrologic variability. Interestingly, these information sensitivities vary significantly across policies depending on how they negotiate tradeoffs between conflicting objectives. We illustrate this analysis in the Red River basin of Vietnam, where four major reservoirs serve to protect the capital of Hanoi from flooding while also providing the surrounding region with electric power and meeting multisectoral water demands for the agricultural and urban economies. Utilizing Evolutionary Multi-Objective Direct Policy Search, we are able to design policies that, using the same information as sequential if/then/else-based operating guidelines developed by the government, outperform these traditional rules with respect to every objective. Policy diagnostics using time-varying sensitivity analysis illustrate how the Evolutionary Multi-Objective Direct Policy Search operations better adapt and coordinate information use to reduce food-energy-water conflicts in the basin. These findings accentuate the benefits of transitioning to dynamic operating policies in order to manage evolving hydroclimatic variability and socioeconomic demands in multipurpose reservoir networks.},

A classic, didactic example is the shallow lake problem in which a hypothetical town situated on a lake must develop pollution control strategies to maximize its economic benefits while minimizing the probability of the lake crossing a critical phosphorus (P) threshold, above which it irreversibly transitions into a eutrophic state. Here, we explore the use of direct policy search (DPS) to design robust pollution control rules for the town that account for deeply uncertain system characteristics and conflicting objectives. The closed loop control formulation of DPS improves the quality and robustness of key management tradeoffs, while dramatically reducing the computational complexity of solving the multi-objective pollution control problem relative to open loop control strategies. These insights suggest DPS is a promising tool for managing socio-ecological systems with deeply uncertain tipping points.}

  abstract = {Planning under deep uncertainty, when probabilistic characterizations of the future are unknown, is a major challenge in water resources management. Many planning frameworks advocate for ``scenario-neutral'' analyses in which alternative policies are evaluated over plausible future scenarios with no assessment of their likelihoods. Instead, these frameworks use sensitivity analysis to discover which uncertain factors have the greatest influence on performance. This knowledge can be used to design monitoring programs and adaptive policies that respond to changes in the critical uncertainties. However, scenario-neutral analyses make implicit assumptions about the range and independence of the uncertain factors that may not be consistent with the coupled human-hydrologic processes influencing the system. These assumptions could influence which factors are found to be most important and which policies are most robust, belying their neutrality; assuming uniformity and independence could have decision-relevant implications. This study illustrates these implications using a multistakeholder planning problem within the Colorado River Basin, where hundreds of rights holders vie for the river's limited water under the law of prior appropriation. Variance-based sensitivity analyses are performed to assess users' vulnerabilities to changing hydrologic conditions using four experimental designs: (1) scenario-neutral samples of hydrologic factors, centered on recent historical conditions, (2) scenarios informed by climate projections, (3) scenarios informed by paleohydrologic reconstructions, and (4) scenario-neutral samples of hydrologic factors spanning all previous experimental designs. Differences in sensitivities and user robustness rankings across the experiments illustrate the challenges of inferring the most consequential drivers of vulnerabilities to design effective monitoring programs and robust management policies.},

  abstract = {Multireservoir systems require robust and adaptive control policies capable of managing hydroclimatic variability and human demands across a range of time scales. This is especially true for river basins with high intraannual and interannual variability, such as monsoonal systems that need to buffer against seasonal droughts while also managing extreme floods. Moreover, the timing, intensity, duration, and frequency of these hydrologic extremes may evolve with deeply uncertain changes in socioeconomic and climatic pressures. This study contributes an innovative method for exploring how possible changes in the timing and magnitude of the monsoonal cycle impact the robustness of reservoir operating policies designed assuming stationary hydrologic and socioeconomic conditions. We illustrate this analysis on the Red River basin in Vietnam, where reservoirs and dams serve as important sources of hydropower production, multisectoral water supply, and flood protection for the capital city of Hanoi. Applying our scenario discovery approach, we find that reservoir operations designed assuming stationarity provide robust hydropower performance in the Red River but that increased mean streamflow, amplification of the within-year monsoonal cycle, and increased interannual variability all threaten their ability to manage flood risk. Additionally, increased agricultural water demands can only be tolerated if they are accompanied by greater mean flow, exacerbating food-flood trade-offs in the basin. These findings highlight the importance of exploring the impacts of a wide range of deeply uncertain socioeconomic and hydrologic factors when evaluating system robustness in monsoonal river basins, considering in particular both lower-order moments of annual streamflow and intraannual monsoonal behavior.},

Traditionally, recommended management strategies are derived by optimizing system operations under a single problem framing that is assumed to accurately represent the system objectives, tacitly ignoring the myriad of effects that could arise from simplifications and mathematical assumptions made when formulating the problem. This study illustrates the benefits of a rival framings framework in which analysts instead interrogate multiple competing hypotheses of how complex water management problems should be formulated. Analyzing rival framings helps discover unintended consequences resulting from inherent biases of alternative problem formulations. We illustrate this on the monsoonal Red River basin in Vietnam by optimizing operations of the system's four largest reservoirs under several different multiobjective problem framings. In each rival framing, we specify different quantitative representations of the system's objectives related to hydropower production, agricultural water supply, and flood protection of the capital city of Hanoi. We find that some formulations result in counterintuitive behavior. In particular, policies designed to minimize expected flood damages inadvertently increase the risk of catastrophic flood events in favor of hydropower production, while min-max objectives commonly used in robust optimization provide poor representations of system tradeoffs due to their instability. This study highlights the importance of carefully formulating and evaluating alternative mathematical abstractions of stakeholder objectives describing the multisectoral water demands and risks associated with hydrologic extremes.},

  abstract = {For much of the world's urban population, centralized treatment plants and pipe networks built in the nineteenth and twentieth centuries provide homes with water and a means of disposing of the resulting wastewater. Due to the real or perceived inability of existing systems to deliver safe and palatable water, many users apply additional treatment prior to consumption. Where piped water supply is lacking, drinking water is obtained through water vendors at considerable cost. Despite economic inefficiencies and public health risks inherent in these two water supply systems, the high sunk costs of existing water infrastructure along with low returns on investment and the inflexible nature of the institutions involved in water provision have slowed down the diffusion of alternative approaches that may prove to be less expensive, more adaptable and safer than the current system. We advocate a third, complementary route: household-based personalized water systems. Initially, relatively affluent people expecting more functionality and sustainability from water systems will invest in personalized water systems that allow them to tailor their water to their personal preferences. This approach will tap into the tremendous creativity-base of individual users and entrepreneurs, facilitating the type of co-creation that accelerated the rapid development of consumer electronics. Competition among manufacturers and economies of scale that accrue as these systems become more popular will lead to rapid innovation that drives down costs, improves performance and expands access. These solutions complement emerging approaches for sanitation and resource recovery that do not rely upon sewers for the management of human waste.}

  abstract = {The basic theory of Markov chains has been known to mathematicians and engineers for close to 80 years, but it is only in the past decade that it has been applied explicitly to problems in speech processing. One of the major reasons why speech models, based on Markov chains, have not been developed until recently was the lack of a method for optimizing the parameters of the Markov model to match observed signal patterns. Such a method was proposed in the late 1960's and was immediately applied to speech processing in several research institutions. Continued refinements in the theory and implementation of Markov modelling techniques have greatly enhanced the method, leading to a wide range of applications of these models. It is the purpose of this tutorial paper to give an introduction to the theory of Markov models, and to illustrate how they have been applied to problems in speech recognition.}

We describe a mathematical object, which we denote universal differential equations (UDEs), as the unifying framework connecting the ecosystem. We show how a wide variety of applications, from automatically discovering biological mechanisms to solving high-dimensional Hamilton-Jacobi-Bellman equations, can be phrased and efficiently handled through the UDE formalism and its tooling. We demonstrate the generality of the software tooling to handle stochasticity, delays, and implicit constraints. This funnels the wide variety of SciML applications into a core set of training mechanisms which are highly optimized, stabilized for stiff equations, and compatible with distributed parallelism and GPU accelerators.},

  abstract = {Flood safety is of the utmost concern for water resources management agencies charged with operating and maintaining reservoir systems. Risk evaluations guide design of infrastructure alterations or lead to potential changes in operations. Changes in climate may change the risk due to floods and therefore decisions to alter infrastructure with a life span of decades or longer may benefit from the use of climate projections as opposed to use of only historical observations. This manuscript presents a set of methods meant to support flood frequency evaluation based on current downscaled climate projections and the potential implications of changing flood risk on how evaluations are made. Methods are demonstrated in four case study basins: the Boise River above Lucky Peak Dam, the San Joaquin River above Friant Dam, the James River above Jamestown Dam, and the Gunnison River above Blue Mesa Dam. The analytical design includes three core elements: (1) a rationale for selecting climate projections to represent available climate projections; (2) generation of runoff projections consistent with climate projections using a process-based hydrologic model and temporal disaggregation of monthly downscaled climate projections into 6-h weather forcings required by the hydrologic model; and (3) analysis of flood frequency distributions based on runoff projection results. In addition to demonstrating the methodology, this paper also presents method choices under each analytical element, and the resulting implications to how flood frequencies are evaluated. The methods used reproduce the antecedent calibration period well. The approach results in a unidirectional shift in modeled flood magnitudes. The comparison between an expanding retrospective (current paradigm for flood frequency estimation) and a lookahead flood frequency approach indicate potential for significant biases in flood frequency estimation.}

  abstract = {Abstract Ensembles used for probabilistic weather forecasting often exhibit a spread-error correlation, but they tend to be underdispersive. This paper proposes a statistical method for postprocessing ensembles based on Bayesian model averaging (BMA), which is a standard method for combining predictive distributions from different sources. The BMA predictive probability density function (PDF) of any quantity of interest is a weighted average of PDFs centered on the individual bias-corrected forecasts, where the weights are equal to posterior probabilities of the models generating the forecasts and reflect the models' relative contributions to predictive skill over the training period. The BMA weights can be used to assess the usefulness of ensemble members, and this can be used as a basis for selecting ensemble members; this can be useful given the cost of running large ensembles. The BMA PDF can be represented as an unweighted ensemble of any desired size, by simulating from the BMA predictive distribution. The BMA predictive variance can be decomposed into two components, one corresponding to the between-forecast variability, and the second to the within-forecast variability. Predictive PDFs or intervals based solely on the ensemble spread incorporate the first component but not the second. Thus BMA provides a theoretical explanation of the tendency of ensembles to exhibit a spread-error correlation but yet be underdispersive. The method was applied to 48-h forecasts of surface temperature in the Pacific Northwest in January\textendash June 2000 using the University of Washington fifth-generation Pennsylvania State University\textendash NCAR Mesoscale Model (MM5) ensemble. The predictive PDFs were much better calibrated than the raw ensemble, and the BMA forecasts were sharp in that 90\% BMA prediction intervals were 66\% shorter on average than those produced by sample climatology. As a by-product, BMA yields a deterministic point forecast, and this had root-mean-square errors 7\% lower than the best of the ensemble members and 8\% lower than the ensemble mean. Similar results were obtained for forecasts of sea level pressure. Simulation experiments show that BMA performs reasonably well when the underlying ensemble is calibrated, or even overdispersed.},

  abstract = {Evolving climate conditions and anthropogenic factors, such as CO2 emissions, urbanization and population growth, can cause changes in weather and climate extremes. Most current risk assessment models rely on the assumption of stationarity (i.e., no temporal change in statistics of extremes). Most nonstationary modeling studies focus primarily on changes in extremes over time. Here, we present Process-informed Nonstationary Extreme Value Analysis (ProNEVA) as a generalized tool for incorporating different types of physical drivers (i.e., underlying processes), stationary and nonstationary concepts, and extreme value analysis methods (i.e., annual maxima, peak-over-threshold). ProNEVA builds upon a newly-developed hybrid evolution Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) approach for numerical parameters estimation and uncertainty assessment. This offers more robust uncertainty estimates of return periods of climatic extremes under both stationary and nonstationary assumptions. ProNEVA is designed as a generalized tool allowing using different types of data and nonstationarity concepts physically-based or purely statistical) into account. In this paper, we show a wide range of applications describing changes in: annual maxima river discharge in response to urbanization, annual maxima sea levels over time, annual maxima temperatures in response to CO2 emissions in the atmosphere, and precipitation with a peak-over-threshold approach. ProNEVA is freely available to the public and includes a user-friendly Graphical User Interface (GUI) to enhance its implementation.}

  abstract = {The evaluation of water systems based on historical statistics is problematic when shifts in the hydrologic system occur due to a changing climate. An explicit link to thermodynamic and dynamic pathways in the climate system that may control water system performance is missing from current operational policies prescribed by regulation manuals within the US. In response, this study contributes an extended version of an existing weather regime (WR)\textendash based stochastic weather generator (SWG) that allows (1)~hourly simulation, (2)~over the entire year, and (3)~with a corrected representation of extremes. A range of climate scenarios is developed to demonstrate the insights that can be gained from linking the impacts of climate change to their thermodynamic and dynamic causal mechanisms, in this case for inflows to the Don Pedro Reservoir within the Tuolumne River Watershed of California. Application of the WR-SWG and water system modeling chain shows that the magnitude of flood events can be heavily influenced by antecedent hydrologic factors such as snow water equivalent (SWE) and soil moisture. Our results suggest that, under all climate change scenarios, SWE decreases as temperature increases and contributes more (sometimes up to 2.5 times more than the baseline) inflow as part of rain-on-snow events. The monthly reservoir inflows show the potential to cause extreme floods as the average rate of inflow increases by up to 80\% with temperature increases, whereas SWE tends to increase by 50\%, adding water to the stream during the high flow season. In addition to the temperature increase, if the water-holding capacity of the atmosphere increases with Clausius-Clapeyron scaling, reservoir inflows are projected to increase. This provides insight for risk-hedging policies: winter storm and spring snowmelt release and storage decisions that drive flood and drought risk, respectively.},

On the demand side, climate change could shift demand patterns due to increased air temperatures. On the supply side, climate change could lead to deratings of thermal units due to changes in air temperature, water temperature, and water availability. Past studies have typically analyzed these risks separately. Here, we developed an integrated, multimodel framework to analyze how compounding risks of climate-change impacts on demand and supply affect long-term planning decisions in the power system. In the southeast U.S., we found that compounding climate-change impacts could result in a 35\% increase in installed capacity by 2050 relative to the reference case. Participation of renewables, particularly solar, in the fleet increased, driven mostly by the expected increase in summertime peak demand. Such capacity requirements would increase investment costs by approximately 31 billion (USD 2015) over the next 30 years, compared to the reference case. These changes in investment decisions align with carbon emission mitigation strategies, highlighting how adaptation and mitigation strategies can converge.}

  abstract = {Photovoltaic (PV) panels directly convert sunlight into electricity; but, sunlight also heats the panels, negatively impacting their efficiency. Green roofs are vegetative layers grown on rooftops, mainly to provide added insulation on the roof to save energy. Green roofs also cool near-surface air temperature. Hence, the joint installation of PV panels and green roofs may potentially lead to higher efficiency of PV panels in certain climates. We develop a two-stage stochastic programming model to optimally place PV panels and green roofs under climate change uncertainty to maximize the overall profit from energy generated and saved. We calibrate the model using the literature, industry reports, and the data from different, at times conflicting, climate projections. We then conduct a case study for a mid-size city in the U.S., perform extensive sensitivity and robustness analyses and provide~insights.}

  abstract = {Green Infrastructure (GI) planning firstly developed as an integrated approach to ecological and conservation planning. Then it has advanced and used in several disciplines such as urban and reginal planning and landscape architecture. This diversity has promoted a range of planning initiatives and widespread its usage while make it difficult to define and operationalize GI planning. However, this is a planning strategy that has the potential to promote urban landscape planning by providing a holistic understanding of the dynamics of socio-ecological systems. GI planning, by producing a variety of ecosystem services, and having proactive multi-function and multi-discipline approach in planning, enhances our ability to deal with climate change in urban scale. Significant advances in GI planning have recently been made in integrating adaptation objectives in plans. However, in incorporating urban GI planning strategy to urban adaptive planning to cope with disasters, many challenges remained linked to integrate these two strategic planning in urban ecological planning with opportunistic response, more than only simple unintegrated defensive strategy. This research tries to take a step in this direction and seeks to investigate what constitutes GI as a strategy, and through this strategy how it can be possible to offer an integrated approach in urban planning practice. Then it investigates what are the key concepts and principles of urban adaptive planning, and how urban adaptive planning can be made operational in urban GI planning practice. In this essay, a transdisciplinary framework for adaptive urban GI planning is proposed to integrate science and professional practice. It includes adaptive strategies from climate change adaptation and ecological planning in a structured form to simultaneously support different type of responses in planning and improve transformability and flexibility in planning and practice.}

  abstract = {Climate change brings new challenges for traditional environmental risk management, particularly for major infrastructure projects, where the decisions made today can have long-term implications. A major challenge is that projections of future climate are deeply uncertain. If this uncertainty is not managed appropriately, long-lived infrastructure may need to be replaced or expensively retrofitted before the end of the design lifetime. The Thames Estuary 2100 Project (TE2100) was one of the first major infrastructure projects to explicitly recognise and address the issue of the deep uncertainty in climate projections throughout the planning process. In this paper, we discuss the innovations and techniques that were adopted in this case that enabled it to cope with this uncertainty. We classify the overall approach as `dynamic robustness', which aims to build flexible strategies that can be changed over time as more is learnt or as conditions change. The project combined four key innovations: (1) the `decision-centric' process; (2) the combination of numerical models and expert judgement to develop narrative sea level rise scenarios; (3) the adoption of an `Adaptation Pathways' approach to identify the timing and sequencing of possible `pathways' of adaptation measures over time under different scenarios; and (4) the development of a monitoring framework that triggers defined decision points. A secondary focus of this paper is an exploration of how climate information was used in TE2100. We suggest that the techniques employed in TE2100 imply different needs from climate science that may cause them to redefine their research priorities related to adaptation; namely a shift in emphasis away from probabilistic modelling, toward greater investment in observations and monitoring; improved understanding of historical climate variability; and improved understanding of physical Earth system processes and their representation in models to enhance `best guess' models and to better bound future projections using narrative scenarios.}

  abstract = {Adaptive policies have emerged as a valuable strategy for dealing with uncertainties by recognising the capacity of systems to adapt over time to new circumstances and surprises. The efficacy of adaptive policies hinges on detecting on-going change and ensuring that actions are indeed taken if and when necessary. This is operationalised by including a monitoring system composed of signposts and triggers in the design of the plan. A well-designed monitoring system is indispensable for the effective implementation of adaptive policies. Despite the importance of monitoring for adaptive policies, the present literature has not considered criteria enabling the a-priori evaluation of the efficacy of signposts. In this paper, we introduce criteria for the evaluation of individual signposts and the monitoring system as a whole. These criteria are relevance, observability, completeness, and parsimony. These criteria are intended to enhance the capacity to detect the need for adaptation in the presence of noisy and ambiguous observations of the real system. The criteria are identified from an analysis of the information chain, from system observations to policy success, focusing on how data becomes information. We illustrate how models, in particular, the combined use of stochastic and exploratory modelling can be used to assess individual signposts, and the whole monitoring system according to these criteria. This analysis provides significant insight into critical factors that may hinder learning from data. The proposed criteria are demonstrated using a hypothetical case, in which a monitoring system for a flood protection policy in the Niger River is designed and tested.}

  abstract = {The representation of nonlinear subgrid processes, especially clouds, has been a major source of uncertainty in climate models for decades. Cloud-resolving models better represent many of these processes and can now be run globally but only for short-term simulations of at most a few years because of computational limitations. Here we demonstrate that deep learning can be used to capture many advantages of cloud-resolving modeling at a fraction of the computational cost. We train a deep neural network to represent all atmospheric subgrid processes in a climate model by learning from a multiscale model in which convection is treated explicitly. The trained neural network then replaces the traditional subgrid parameterizations in a global general circulation model in which it freely interacts with the resolved dynamics and the surface-flux scheme. The prognostic multiyear simulations are stable and closely reproduce not only the mean climate of the cloud-resolving simulation but also key aspects of variability, including precipitation extremes and the equatorial wave spectrum. Furthermore, the neural network approximately conserves energy despite not being explicitly instructed to. Finally, we show that the neural network parameterization generalizes to new surface forcing patterns but struggles to cope with temperatures far outside its training manifold. Our results show the feasibility of using deep learning for climate model parameterization. In a broader context, we anticipate that data-driven Earth system model development could play a key role in reducing climate prediction uncertainty in the coming decade.},

In historical perspective, PNS evolved from a criticism of Probabilistic Risk Analysis, and put the essentially political idea of Extended Peer Community at its core. Establishing the legitimacy of the EPC requires a review of the methodology of science in the policy process. The time is not ripe for a modification of PNS, and so the best move forward is to raise the issue of Sustainability. For that I sketch a theory of complex systems, with special attention to pathologies and failures. That provides the foundation for a use of `contradiction' as a problem incapable of resolution in its own terms, and also of `characteristic contradiction' that drives a system to a crisis. With those materials it is possible to state the characteristic contradiction of our modern industrial civilisation, and provide a diagram with heuristic power.}

  abstract = {A Bayesian model that uses the spatial dependence induced by the river network topology, and the leading principal components of regional tree ring chronologies for paleo-streamflow reconstruction is presented. In any river basin, a convergent, dendritic network of tributaries come together to form the main stem of a river. Consequently, it is natural to think of a spatial Markov process that recognizes this topological structure to develop a spatially consistent basin-scale streamflow reconstruction model that uses the information in streamflow and tree ring chronology data to inform the reconstructed flows, while maintaining the space-time correlation structure of flows that is critical for water resource assessments and management. Given historical data from multiple streamflow gauges along a river, their tributaries in a watershed, and regional tree ring chronologies, the model is fit and used to simultaneously reconstruct the full network of paleo-streamflow at all gauges in the basin progressing upstream to downstream along the river. Our application to 18 streamflow gauges in the Upper Missouri River Basin shows that the mean adjusted R2 for the basin is approximately 0.5 with good overall cross-validated skill as measured by five different skill metrics. The spatial network structure produced a substantial reduction in the uncertainty associated with paleo-streamflow as one proceeds downstream in the network aggregating information from upstream gauges and tree ring chronologies. Uncertainty was reduced by more than 50\% at six gauges, between 6\% and 50\% at one gauge, and by less than 5\% at the remaining 11 gauges when compared with the traditional principal component regression reconstruction model.},

  abstract = {Precipitation nowcasting, the high-resolution forecasting of precipitation up to two hours ahead, supports the real-world socioeconomic needs of many sectors reliant on weather-dependent decision-making1,2. State-of-the-art operational nowcasting methods typically advect precipitation fields with radar-based wind estimates, and struggle to capture important non-linear events such as convective initiations3,4. Recently introduced deep learning methods use radar to directly predict future rain rates, free of physical constraints5,6. While they accurately predict low-intensity rainfall, their operational utility is limited because their lack of constraints produces blurry nowcasts at longer lead times, yielding poor performance on rarer medium-to-heavy rain events. Here we present a deep generative model for the probabilistic nowcasting of precipitation from radar that addresses these challenges. Using statistical, economic and cognitive measures, we show that our method provides improved forecast quality, forecast consistency and forecast value. Our model produces realistic and spatiotemporally consistent predictions over regions up to 1,536\,km\,\texttimes\,1,280\,km and with lead times from 5\textendash 90\,min ahead. Using a systematic evaluation by more than 50 expert meteorologists, we show that our generative model ranked first for its accuracy and usefulness in 89\% of cases against two competitive methods. When verified quantitatively, these nowcasts are skillful without resorting to blurring. We show that generative nowcasting can provide probabilistic predictions that improve forecast value and support operational utility, and at resolutions and lead times where alternative methods struggle.},

The World Bank's decision tree framework (DTF) for ``confronting climate uncertainty'' is one incarnation of those paradigms. In order to better represent the state of the art in climate change risk assessment and evaluation techniques, this paper proposes: (1) an update to the DTF, replacing its ``climate change stress test'' with a multidimensional stress test; and (2) the addition of a Bayesian network framework that represents joint probabilistic behavior of uncertain parameters as sensitivity factors to aid in the weighting of scenarios of concern (the combination of conditions under which a water system fails to meet its performance targets). Using the updated DTF, water system planners and project managers would be better able to understand the relative magnitudes of the varied risks they face, and target investments in adaptation measures to best reduce their vulnerabilities to change. Next steps for the DTF include enhancements in: modeling of extreme event risks; coupling of human-hydrologic systems; integration of surface water and groundwater systems; the generation of tradeoffs between economic, social, and ecological factors; incorporation of water quality considerations; and interactive data visualization.},

In this perspective paper, a multidisciplinary group of researchers and practitioners revisit the current status of SA, and outline research challenges in regard to both theoretical frameworks and their applications to solve real-world problems. Six areas are discussed that warrant further attention, including (1) structuring and standardizing SA as a discipline, (2) realizing the untapped potential of SA for systems modeling, (3) addressing the computational burden of SA, (4) progressing SA in the context of machine learning, (5) clarifying the relationship and role of SA to uncertainty quantification, and (6) evolving the use of SA in support of decision making. An outlook for the future of SA is provided that underlines how SA must underpin a wide variety of activities to better serve science and society.}

  abstract = {This study contributes one of the largest parallel scalability experiments ever attempted within the water resources literature to date, encompassing 2000 years of computational time. A severely challenging multiobjective benchmark problem focusing on urban water portfolio planning under uncertainty in the Lower Rio Grande Valley (LRGV) is used to demonstrate that a multimaster variant of the Borg multiobjective evolutionary algorithm (MOEA) can be used efficiently on more than 524,288 compute cores. The scalability of the multimaster Borg MOEA enables users to compress up to 20 years of computational work into 20 min of actual wall-clock time. Beyond these temporal efficiency gains, metric-based statistical assessments of solution quality show that the multimaster Borg MOEA dramatically enhances the effectiveness and reliability of the algorithm's autoadaptive search features. Theoretical algorithmic analysis shows that the multimaster Borg MOEA could maintain high levels of parallel scalability on future exascale computing platforms (i.e., millions of compute cores). These results mark a fundamental expansion of the scope, computational demands, and difficulties that can be addressed in multiobjective water resources applications.},

  abstract = {The energy sector relies on analytical results to inform decision-making\textemdash from policy to investment. Over the last decade the United States has undergone a ``revolution'' in its energy landscape, due primarily to natural gas production from shale plays, as well as other factors. Despite the enormity of this change, it was hardly, or not at all, predicted or projected by forecasters, analysts, or industry experts even a year or two before its emergence. We consider what the projections looked like, how changeable they still remain, and implications for refining the interaction between analysis and decision-making in the energy sector. More broadly, we use the shale gas boom to illuminate the more universal challenges that energy forecasters face\textemdash and the solutions they employ\textemdash in managing and explaining two significant types of uncertainty: epistemic (unknown unknowns) and stochastic (known unknowns). Epistemic and stochastic uncertainties affect both the production of forecasts as abstractions of reality and our meta-considerations of how accurately such abstractions represent reality. Compounding these difficulties, these two domains of prediction\textemdash the world of the model and the world the model attempts to simulate\textemdash are often unconsciously confused or conflated, especially by the consumers of energy forecasts who do not themselves deal directly with forecast intricacies: industry analysts, scientists, advocates, and policymakers, among others. We thus attempt to elucidate a simple typology of energy forecast uncertainties and delineate the domains of prediction for decision-makers in the private, public, and research sectors who may benefit from a better understanding of how modelers themselves conceptualize and manage uncertainty. We conclude with a call for new and innovative discourse modes for discussing uncertainty in energy forecasting, both within the modeling community itself and in its engagements with decision-makers.}

This study provides the most comprehensive diagnostic assessment of MOEAs for water resources to date, exploiting more than 100,000 MOEA runs and trillions of design evaluations. The diagnostic assessment measures the effectiveness, efficiency, reliability, and controllability of ten benchmark MOEAs for a representative suite of water resources applications addressing rainfall\textendash runoff calibration, long-term groundwater monitoring (LTM), and risk-based water supply portfolio planning. The suite of problems encompasses a range of challenging problem properties including (1) many-objective formulations with four or more objectives, (2) multi-modality (or false optima), (3) nonlinearity, (4) discreteness, (5) severe constraints, (6) stochastic objectives, and (7) non-separability (also called epistasis). The applications are representative of the dominant problem classes that have shaped the history of MOEAs in water resources and that will be dominant foci in the future. Recommendations are given for the new algorithms that should serve as the benchmarks for innovations in the water resources literature. The future of MOEAs in water resources needs to emphasize self-adaptive search, new technologies for visualizing tradeoffs, and the next generation of computing technologies.}

  abstract = {Abstract Soil moisture controls the partitioning of moisture and energy fluxes at the land surface and is a key variable in weather and climate prediction. The performance of the ensemble Kalman filter (EnKF) for soil moisture estimation is assessed by assimilating L-band (1.4 GHz) microwave radiobrightness observations into a land surface model. An optimal smoother (a dynamic variational method) is used as a benchmark for evaluating the filter's performance. In a series of synthetic experiments the effect of ensemble size and non-Gaussian forecast errors on the estimation accuracy of the EnKF is investigated. With a state vector dimension of 4608 and a relatively small ensemble size of 30 (or 100; or 500), the actual errors in surface soil moisture at the final update time are reduced by 55\% (or 70\%; or 80\%) from the value obtained without assimilation (as compared to 84\% for the optimal smoother). For robust error variance estimates, an ensemble of at least 500 members is needed. The dynamic evolution of the estimation error variances is dominated by wetting and drying events with high variances during drydown and low variances when the soil is either very wet or very dry. Furthermore, the ensemble distribution of soil moisture is typically symmetric except under very dry or wet conditions when the effects of the nonlinearities in the model become significant. As a result, the actual errors are consistently larger than ensemble-derived forecast and analysis error variances. This suggests that the update is suboptimal. However, the degree of suboptimality is relatively small and results presented here indicate that the EnKF is a flexible and robust data assimilation option that gives satisfactory estimates even for moderate ensemble sizes.},

  abstract = {Deep uncertainty in future climatic and economic conditions complicates developing infrastructure designed to last several generations, such as water reservoirs. In response, analysts have developed multiple robust decision frameworks to help identify investments and policies that can withstand a wide range of future states. Although these frameworks are adept at supporting decisions where uncertainty cannot be represented probabilistically, analysts necessarily choose probabilistic bounds and distributions for uncertain variables to support exploratory modeling. The implications of these assumptions on the analytical outcomes of robust decision frameworks are rarely evaluated, and little guidance exists in terms of how to select uncertain variable distributions. Here, we evaluate the impact of these choices by following the robust decision-making procedure, using four different assumptions about the probabilistic distribution of exogenous uncertainties in future climatic and economic states. We take a water reservoir system in Ethiopia as our case study, and sample climatic parameters from uniform, normal, extended uniform, and extended normal distributions; we similarly sample two economic parameters. We compute regret and satisficing robustness decision criteria for two performance measures, agricultural water demand coverage and net present value, and perform scenario discovery on the most robust reservoir alternative. We find lower robustness scores resulting from extended parameter distributions and demonstrate that parameter distributions can impact vulnerabilities identified through scenario discovery. Our results suggest that exploratory modeling within robust decision frameworks should sample from extended, uniform parameters distributions.}

Objectivity is oftenconsidered to be an ideal for scientific inquiry, a good reason forvaluing scientific knowledge, and the basis of the authority ofscience in society., Many central debates in the philosophy of science have, in one way oranother, to do with objectivity: confirmation and the problem ofinduction; theory choice and scientific change; realism; scientificexplanation; experimentation; measurement and quantification;statistical evidence; reproducibility; evidence-based science;feminism and values in science. Understanding the role of objectivityin science is therefore integral to a full appreciation of thesedebates. As this article testifies, the reverse is true too: it isimpossible to fully appreciate the notion of scientific objectivitywithout touching upon many of these debates., The ideal of objectivity has been criticized repeatedly in philosophyof science, questioning both its desirability and its attainability.This article focuses on the question of how scientific objectivityshould be defined, whether the ideal of objectivity isdesirable, and to what extent scientists can achieveit.}

This paper seeks to develop this agenda by reviewing how these modelling approaches incorporate, consider, and appraise information of value to land-use planning, policy, and practice to better understand why their implementation is infrequent and to help develop a research agenda. Our findings indicate that the information generated by current GI modelling approaches are not well integrated into the demands of land-use planning, and may more reflect the information availability than useability. We find that modelling outputs do not tend to generate the type of high resolution information covering the appropriate spatial and temporal scales that is needed to best support planning decisions. There are also gaps in the assessment of future climate risks, such as increased rainfall intensity, and how this links to future pressures, such as escalating urban growth and development demands, and the interaction between the two areas. The paper concludes that to increase the implementation of green infrastructure, modelling researchers should work more closely with decision-makers to better link data on the effects of GI to the politics involved in their implementation in planning decisions, particularly how trade-offs occur over different scales and times, and between sectors.}

The weekly product has been available since 1993 and is widely used for weather and climate monitoring and forecasting. Errors in the satellite bias correction and the sea ice to SST conversion algorithm are discussed, and then an improved version of the OI analysis is developed. The changes result in a modest reduction in the satellite bias that leaves small global residual biases of roughly -0.03\textdegree C. The major improvement in the analysis occurs at high latitudes due to the new sea ice algorithm where local differences between the old and new analysis can exceed 1\textdegree C. Comparisons with other SST products are needed to determine the consistency of the OI. These comparisons show that the differences among products occur on large time- and space scales with monthly rms differences exceeding 0.5\textdegree C in some regions. These regions are primarily the mid- and high-latitude Southern Oceans and the Arctic where data are sparse, as well as high-gradient areas such as the Gulf Stream and Kuroshio where the gradients cannot be properly resolved on a 1\textdegree{} grid. In addition, globally averaged differences of roughly 0.05\textdegree C occur among the products on decadal scales. These differences primarily arise from the same regions where the rms differences are large. However, smaller unexplained differences also occur in other regions of the midlatitude Northern Hemisphere where in situ data should be adequate.}

  abstract = {This paper presents the overview of the Shared Socioeconomic Pathways (SSPs) and their energy, land use, and emissions implications. The SSPs are part of a new scenario framework, established by the climate change research community in order to facilitate the integrated analysis of future climate impacts, vulnerabilities, adaptation, and mitigation. The pathways were developed over the last years as a joint community effort and describe plausible major global developments that together would lead in the future to different challenges for mitigation and adaptation to climate change. The SSPs are based on five narratives describing alternative socio-economic developments, including sustainable development, regional rivalry, inequality, fossil-fueled development, and middle-of-the-road development. The long-term demographic and economic projections of the SSPs depict a wide uncertainty range consistent with the scenario literature. A multi-model approach was used for the elaboration of the energy, land-use and the emissions trajectories of SSP-based scenarios. The baseline scenarios lead to global energy consumption of 400\textendash 1200 EJ in 2100, and feature vastly different land-use dynamics, ranging from a possible reduction in cropland area up to a massive expansion by more than 700 million hectares by 2100. The associated annual CO2 emissions of the baseline scenarios range from about 25 GtCO2 to more than 120 GtCO2 per year by 2100. With respect to mitigation, we find that associated costs strongly depend on three factors: (1) the policy assumptions, (2) the socio-economic narrative, and (3) the stringency of the target. The carbon price for reaching the target of 2.6W/m2 that is consistent with a temperature change limit of 2\textdegree C, differs in our analysis thus by about a factor of three across the SSP marker scenarios. Moreover, many models could not reach this target from the SSPs with high mitigation challenges. While the SSPs were designed to represent different mitigation and adaptation challenges, the resulting narratives and quantifications span a wide range of different futures broadly representative of the current literature. This allows their subsequent use and development in new assessments and research projects. Critical next steps for the community scenario process will, among others, involve regional and sectoral extensions, further elaboration of the adaptation and impacts dimension, as well as employing the SSP scenarios with the new generation of earth system models as part of the 6th climate model intercomparison project (CMIP6).}

  abstract = {This paper presents a thorough review of 75 modelling tools currently used for analysing energy and electricity systems. Increased activity within model development in recent years has led to several new models and modelling capabilities, partly motivated by the need to better represent the integration of variable renewables. The purpose of this paper is to give an updated overview of currently available modelling tools, their capabilities and to serve as an aid for modellers in their process of identifying and choosing an appropriate model. A broad spectrum of modelling tools, ranging from small-scale power system analysis tools to global long-term energy models, has been assessed. Key information regarding the general logic, spatiotemporal resolution as well as the technological and economic features of the models is presented in three comprehensive tables. This information has been validated and updated by model developers or affiliated contact persons, and is state-of-the-art as of the submission date. With the available suite of modelling tools, most challenges of today's electricity system can be assessed. For a future with an increasing share of variable renewables and increasing electrification of the energy system, there are some challenges such as how to represent short-term variability in long-term studies, incorporate the effect of climate change and ensure openness and transparency in modelling studies.}

We develop an approach to estimate the economic potential of crop reallocation using a Bayesian hierarchical model of yields. We apply the model to six crops in the United States, and show that it outperforms traditional empirical models under cross-validation. The fitted model parameters provide evidence of considerable existing climate adaptation across counties. If crop locations are held constant in the future, total agriculture profits for the six crops will drop by 31\% for the temperature patterns of 2070 under RCP 8.5. When crop lands are reallocated to avoid yield decreases and take advantage of yield increases, half of these losses are avoided (16\% loss), but 57\% of counties are allocated crops different from those currently planted. Our results provide a framework for identifying crop adaptation opportunities, but suggest limits to their potential.},

This article addresses a gap in literature by proposing natural disasters as a variable to help understand the African American experience. The authors argue that the first post-Civil War migration altered the life courses for many. Subsequent to the first migration wave (the Great Migration of 1916-1930), environmental factors altered many African American lives. Natural disasters such as The Great Mississippi River Flood of 1927, The 1948 Vanport Flood, and Hurricane Katrina illustrate the federal government's indifference and neglect of responsibility, which played a role in decisions to migrate. These major natural environmental disasters, when situated in historical context as a part of the social, political, geographical, and economic landscape, are vital in the understanding of the African American experience.}

However, many approaches to reconstructing climate are limited in their ability to address sampling variability inherent in different climate proxies. We iteratively optimise an ensemble of possible reconstruction data series to maximise the Gaussian kernel correlation of Rehfeld et al. (2011) which reconciles differences in the temporal resolution of both the target variable and proxies or covariates. The reconstruction method is evaluated using synthetic data with different degrees of sampling variability and noise. Two examples using paleoclimate proxy records and a third using instrumental rainfall data with missing values are used to demonstrate the utility of the method. While the Gaussian kernel correlation method is relatively computationally expensive, it is shown to be robust under a range of data characteristics and will therefore be valuable in analyses seeking to employ multiple input proxies or covariates.}

Station-averaged observed daily rainfall amount is prescribed as an input to the NHMM, which is then used to disaggregate the rainfall in space. These rainfall simulations are then used as inputs to a Crop Estimation through Resource and Environment Synthesis (CERES) crop model for maize. Regionally averaged yields derived from the NHMM rainfall simulations are found to correlate very highly ({$<$}em{$>$}r{$<$}/em{$>$} = 0.93) with those generated by the crop model using observed rainfall; stationwise correlations range between 0.44 and 0.74. Rainfall and crop simulations are then constructed under increasing degrees of temporal smoothing applied to the regional rainfall input to the NHMM, designed to exclude the submonthly weather details that would be unpredictable in seasonal climate forecasts. Regional yields are found to be remarkably insensitive to this temporal smoothing; even with 90-day low-pass-filtered inputs to the NHMM, resulting yields are still correlated at 0.85 with the baseline simulation, whereas stationwise correlations range between 0.18 and 0.68. From these findings, it is expected that regional maize yields over the southeastern United States will be largely insensitive to year-to-year details of subseasonal rainfall variability; they should be downscalable, in principle, using an NHMM from climate forecasts archived at daily resolution, with the important caveat that the latter need to be skillful enough at the 90-day time scale. As a by-product of the analysis, subseasonal-to-interdecadal summer rainfall variability over the southeastern United States is interpretable in terms of six discrete weather states indicative of a monsoonlike climate regime. Low-simulated-yield years are found to be associated with delayed summer rainfall onset.{$<$}/p{$><$}/section{$>$}},

  abstract = {A hidden Markov model (HMM) is used to describe daily rainfall occurrence at 10 gauge stations in the state of Cear\'a in northeast Brazil during the February\textendash April wet season 1975\textendash 2002. The model assumes that rainfall occurrence is governed by a few discrete states, with Markovian daily transitions between them. Four ``hidden'' rainfall states are identified. One pair of the states represents wet-versus-dry conditions at all stations, while a second pair of states represents north\textendash south gradients in rainfall occurrence. The estimated daily state-sequence is characterized by a systematic seasonal evolution, together with considerable variability on intraseasonal, interannual, and longer time scales. The first pair of states are shown to be associated with large-scale displacements of the tropical convergence zones, and with teleconnections typical of the El Ni\~no\textendash Southern Oscillation and the North Atlantic Oscillation. A nonhomogeneous HMM (NHMM) is then used to downscale daily precipitation occurrence at the 10 stations, using general circulation model (GCM) simulations of seasonal-mean large-scale precipitation, obtained with historical sea surface temperatures prescribed globally. Interannual variability of the GCM's large-scale precipitation simulation is well correlated with seasonal- and spatial-averaged station rainfall-occurrence data. Simulations from the NHMM are found to be able to reproduce this relationship. The GCM-NHMM simulations are also able to capture quite well interannual changes in daily rainfall occurrence and 10-day dry spell frequencies at some individual stations. It is suggested that the NHMM provides a useful tool (a) to understand the statistics of daily rainfall occurrence at the station level in terms of large-scale atmospheric patterns, and (b) to produce station-scale daily rainfall sequence scenarios for input into crop models, etc.}

Removing these biases before downscaling can potentially improve regional climate change impact assessment. In particular, reducing the low-frequency variability biases in atmospheric variables as well as modeled rainfall is important for hydrological impact assessment, predominantly for the improved simulation of floods and droughts. The impact of this bias in the lateral boundary conditions driving the dynamical downscaling has not been explored before. Here the use of three approaches for correcting the lateral boundary biases including mean, variance, and modification of sample moments through the use of a nested bias correction (NBC) method that corrects for low-frequency variability bias is investigated. These corrections are implemented at the 6-hourly time scale on the global climate model simulati...}

  abstract = {Arctic warming was more pronounced than warming in midlatitudes in the last decades making this region a hotspot of climate change. Associated with this, a rapid decline of sea-ice extent and a decrease of its thickness has been observed. Sea-ice retreat allows for an increased transport of heat and momentum from the ocean up to the tropo- and stratosphere by enhanced upward propagation of planetary-scale atmospheric waves. In the upper atmosphere, these waves deposit the momentum transported, disturbing the stratospheric polar vortex, which can lead to a breakdown of this circulation with the potential to also significantly impact the troposphere in mid- to late-winter and early spring. Therefore, an accurate representation of stratospheric processes in climate models is necessary to improve the understanding of the impact of retreating sea ice on the atmospheric circulation. By modeling the atmospheric response to a prescribed decline in Arctic sea ice, we show that including interactive stratospheric ozone chemistry in atmospheric model calculations leads to an improvement in tropo-stratospheric interactions compared to simulations without interactive chemistry. This suggests that stratospheric ozone chemistry is important for the understanding of sea ice related impacts on atmospheric dynamics.},

During hot hours, a key protective adaptation is increased air conditioning and associated consumption of electricity for cooling. But during cold hours, milder temperatures have the offsetting effect of reducing consumption of electricity and other fuels for heating. We elucidate the net consequences of these opposing effects in 36 cities in different world regions. We couple reduced-form statistical models of cities' hourly responses of electric load to temperature with temporally downscaled projections of temperatures simulated by 21 global climate models (GCMs), projecting the effects of warming on the demand for electricity circa 2050. Cities' responses, temperature exposures and impacts are heterogeneous, with changes in total annual consumption ranging from \$\$-2.7\$\$to 5.7\%, and peak power demand increasing by as much as 9.5\% at the multi-GCM median. The largest increases are concentrated in more economically developed mid-latitude cities, with less developed urban areas in the tropics exhibiting relatively small changes. The results highlight the important role of the structure of electricity demand: large temperature increases in tropical cities are offset by their inelastic responses, which can be attributed to lower air-conditioning penetration.},

  abstract = {Urban development is a contributor to increased peak runoff and adverse hydrologic effects in regional catchments. On-Site Stormwater Detention (OSD) is a common way to mitigate these problems, however it is well known that OSD can have the opposite effect when it is installed at inappropriate locations. Parameter uncertainty and the need for a probabilistic approach to hydrograph generation are also factors that add to concerns regarding our reliance on OSD for the protection of regional hydrology. This study contributes to awareness of these issues and a practical solution to the problem. A hydrologic model for Monte Carlo simulation of regional catchment hydrographs has been developed using interrelated modules based on previous studies. A sample of ten regional catchments has been modelled with three simulation scenarios: i) status quo, ii) a land parcel of varying sizes is urbanised at varying locations within the regional catchment, and iii) the urbanised land parcel includes OSD. The focus on the results has been the identification and analysis of two key parameters that influence the regional catchments' peak runoff, being the size and location of the urbanised land parcel. A regression analysis of the model results has revealed recurring patterns that have been used to develop new equations for predicting the mean impact of urbanisation and OSD on regional catchment peak runoff. The study highlights the significance of rainfall pattern uncertainty and the importance of considering land parcel location in considering the need for OSD as part of urban land development projects.},

Urban flood models are numerical models that have the capability of representing the features of urban ecosystems and the mechanisms of flooding that impact them. They have the potential to play a critical role in flood risk assessment, operational response, and resilience planning, but existing models remain limited in their capability to represent integrated flooding processes in urban areas and provide the credible quantitative information needed to support risk assessment and resilience practice. Research to advance model development, facilitate intensive watershed monitoring for model parameterization and validation, and support collaboration between researchers and practitioners should be prioritized. This will represent a substantial, expensive effort, but will still be of great value as cities are faced with urgent challenges posed by climate change in coming decades.}

  abstract = {Water problems due to scarcity, inaccessibility, or poor quality are a major barrier to household functioning, livelihood, and health globally. Household-to-household water borrowing has been posited as a strategy to alleviate unmet water needs. However, the prevalence and predictors of this practice have not been systematically examined. Therefore, we tested whether water borrowing occurs across diverse global contexts with varying water problems. Second, we tested if household water borrowing is associated with unmet water needs, perceived socio-economic status (SES), and/or water-related system failures, and if water access moderated (or changed) these relationships. Using survey data from the Household Water Insecurity Experiences (HWISE) study from 21 sites in 19 low- and middle-income countries (n\,=\,5495 households), we found that household-to-household water borrowing was practiced in all 21 sites, with 44.7\% (11.4\textendash 85.4\%) of households borrowing water at least once the previous month. Multilevel mixed-effect logistic regression models demonstrate that high unmet water needs (odds ratio [OR]\,=\,2.86], 95\% confidence interval [CI]\,=\,2.09\textendash 3.91), low perceived SES (OR\,=\,1.09; 95\% CI\,=\,1.05\textendash 1.13), and water-related system failures (23\textendash 258\%) were all significantly associated with higher odds of water borrowing. Significant interactions (all p\,{$<$}\,0.01) between water access, unmet water needs, and water-related system failures on water borrowing indicate that water access moderates these relationships. These data are the first to demonstrate that borrowing water is commonly used by households around the world to cope with water insecurity. Due to how prevalent water borrowing is, its implications for social dynamics, resource allocation, and health and well-being are likely vast but severely under-recognized.}

  abstract = {There is a growing desire in the field of reinforcement learning (and machine learning in general) to move from black-box models toward more "interpretable AI." We improve interpretability of reinforcement learning by increasing the utility of decision tree policies learned via reinforcement learning. These policies consist of a decision tree over the state space, which requires fewer parameters to express than traditional policy representations. Existing methods for creating decision tree policies via reinforcement learning focus on accurately representing an action-value function during training, but this leads to much larger trees than would otherwise be required. To address this shortcoming, we propose a novel algorithm which only increases tree size when the estimated discounted future reward of the overall policy would increase by a sufficient amount. Through evaluation in a simulated environment, we show that its performance is comparable or superior to traditional tree-based approaches and that it yields a more succinct policy. Additionally, we discuss tuning parameters to control the tradeoff between optimizing for smaller tree size or for overall reward.},

Although trends in jet waviness are still under discussion, it is crucial to better understand the mechanisms through which jet waviness affects weather extremes. Here we show that variations in jet waviness on regional scales effectively modulate the occurrence of daily weather extremes, however, in regionally different ways. The jet waviness over the North Atlantic and the North Pacific mainly affects where wind, precipitation and cold extremes occur, while a wavy jet over Eurasia strongly favors the occurrence of hot extremes in summer. This is because regional variations of jet waviness are intrinsically linked to the occurrence and tracks of synoptic-scale weather systems, which can trigger the extremes. We conclude that potential jet waviness changes would affect the occurrence of weather extremes differently depending on where these changes occur.}

A measure of the quality of the forecasting scheme, based on the amount of a data compression it allows, is outlined. This measure, called ignorance, is a logarithmic scoring rule that is a modified version of relative entropy and can be calculated for real forecasts and realizations. It is equivalent to the expected returns that would be obtained by placing bets proportional to the forecast probabilities. Like the cost\textendash loss score, ignorance is not equivalent to the Brier score, but, unlike cost\textendash loss scores, ignorance easily generalizes beyond binary decision scenarios. The use of the skill score is illustrated by evaluating the ECMWF ensemble forecasts for temperature at London's Heathrow airport.}

Next, we evaluate the CFSv2 forecasts in terms of their ability to capture different drought signals as reflected in the analysis data. Precipitation from both sources is partitioned into recycled and advected components using a moisture accounting\textendash based precipitation recycling model. All four variables reflected drought signals through their anomalously low values, while precipitation and evapotranspiration had the strongest signals. Drought in Texas was dominated by the differences in moisture transport, whereas in the Upper Midwest, the absence of strong precipitation-generating mechanisms was a crucial factor. Reduced advection from the tropical and midlatitude Atlantic contributed to the drought in Texas. The Upper Midwest experienced reduced contributions from recycling, terrestrial sources, the midlatitude Pacific, and the tropical Atlantic. In both cases, long-range moisture transport from oceanic sources was reduced during the corresponding drought years. June and August in Texas and July and August in the Upper Midwest were the driest months, and in both cases, drought was alleviated by the end of August. Moisture from terrestrial sources most likely contributed to alleviating drought intensity in such conditions, even with negative anomalies. The forecasts showed noticeable differences as compared to the analysis for multiple variables in both regions, which could be attributed to several factors as discussed in this paper.}

  abstract = {The scientific community is now developing a new set of scenarios, referred to as Shared Socio-economic Pathways (SSPs) that will be contrasted along two axes: challenges to mitigation, and challenges to adaptation. This paper proposes a methodology to develop SSPs with a ``backwards'' approach based on (i) an a priori identification of potential drivers of mitigation and adaptation challenges; (ii) a modelling exercise to transform these drivers into a large set of scenarios; (iii) an a posteriori selection of a few SSPs among these scenarios using statistical cluster-finding algorithms. This backwards approach could help inform the development of SSPs to ensure the storylines focus on the driving forces most relevant to distinguishing between the SSPs. In this illustrative analysis, we find that energy sobriety, equity and convergence prove most important towards explaining future difference in challenges to adaptation and mitigation. The results also demonstrate the difficulty in finding explanatory drivers for a middle scenario (SSP2). We argue that methodologies such as that used here are useful for broad questions such as the definition of SSPs, and could also be applied to any specific decisions faced by decision-makers in the field of climate change.}

With a projected increase in extreme precipitation as well as an ongoing urbanization, pluvial flood damage is expected to increase in the future. Therefore, further insights, especially on the adverse consequences of pluvial floods and their mitigation, are needed. To gain more knowledge, empirical damage data from three different pluvial flood events in Germany were collected through computer-aided telephone interviews. Pluvial flood awareness as well as flood experience were found to be low before the respective flood events. The level of private precaution increased considerably after all events, but is mainly focused on measures that are easy to implement. Lower inundation depths, smaller potential losses as compared with fluvial floods, as well as the fact that pluvial flooding may occur everywhere, are expected to cause a shift in damage mitigation from precaution to emergency response. However, an effective implementation of emergency measures was constrained by a low dissemination of early warnings in the study areas. Further improvements of early warning systems including dissemination as well as a rise in pluvial flood preparedness are important to reduce future pluvial flood damage.}

However, the risk of pluvial flooding is a growing challenge with a projected increase of extreme rainstorms compounding with an ongoing global urbanization. Considered as a flood type with minimal impacts when rainfall rates exceed the capacity of urban drainage systems, the aftermath of rainfall-triggered flooding during Hurricane Harvey and other events show the urgent need to assess the risk of pluvial flooding. Due to the local extent and small scale variations, the quantification of pluvial flood risk requires risk assessments on high spatial resolutions. While flood hazard and exposure information is becoming increasingly accurate, the estimation of losses is still a poorly understood component of pluvial flood risk quantification. We use a new probabilistic multi-variable modeling approach to estimate pluvial flood losses of individual buildings, explicitly accounting for the associated uncertainties. Except for the water depth as the common most important predictor, we identified the drivers for having loss or not and for the degree of loss to be different. Applying this approach to estimate and validate building structure losses during Hurricane Harvey using a property level data set, we find that the reliability and dispersion of predictive loss distributions vary widely depending on the model and aggregation level of property level loss estimates. Our results show that the use of multi-variable zero-inflated beta models reduce the 90\% prediction intervals for Hurricane Harvey building structure loss estimates on average by 78\% (totalling US\$ 3.8 billion) compared to commonly used models.},

However, the hurricanes also resulted in unintended hazardous substances releases in the affected states. Data from two states (Louisiana and Texas) participating in the Hazardous Substances Emergency Events Surveillance (HSEES) system were analyzed to describe the characteristics of hazardous substances releases in industrial settings associated with Hurricanes Katrina and Rita. HSEES is an active multi-state Web-based surveillance system maintained by the Agency for Toxic Substances and Disease Registry (ATSDR). In 2005, 166 hurricane-related hazardous substances events in industrial settings in Louisiana and Texas were reported. Most (72.3\%) releases were due to emergency shut downs in preparation for the hurricanes and start-ups after the hurricanes. Emphasis is given to the contributing causal factors, hazardous substances released, and event scenarios. Recommendations are made to prevent or minimize acute releases of hazardous substances during future hurricanes, including installing backup power generation, securing equipment and piping to withstand high winds, establishing procedures to shutdown process operations safely, following established and up-to-date start-up procedures and checklists, and carefully performing pre-start-up safety reviews.}

What causes this divergence and which projection(s) should a decision maker adopt to create plans and adaptation efforts for improving coastal resiliency? Using Norfolk, Virginia, as a case study, we start to address these questions by characterizing and quantifying the drivers of differences between published sea-level rise and storm surge projections, and how these differences can impact efforts to improve coastal resilience. We find that assumptions about the complex behavior of ice sheets are the primary drivers of flood hazard diversity. Adopting a single hazard projection neglects key uncertainties and can lead to overconfident projections and downwards biased hazard estimates. These results highlight key avenues to improve the usefulness of hazard projections to inform decision-making such as (i) representing complex ice sheet behavior, (ii) covering decision-relevant timescales beyond this century, (iii) resolving storm surges with a low chance of occurring (e.g., a 0.2\% chance per year), (iv) considering that storm surge projections may deviate from the historical record, and (v) communicating the considerable deep uncertainty.},

  abstract = {Coastal floods often coincide with large waves, storm surge and tides. Thus, joint probability methods are needed to properly characterize extreme sea levels. This work introduces a statistical downscaling framework for multivariate extremes that relates the non-stationary behavior of coastal flooding events to the occurrence probability of daily weather patterns. The proposed method is based on recently-developed weather-type methods to predict extreme events (e.g., significant wave height, mean wave period, surge level) from large-scale sea-level pressure fields. For each weather type, variables of interest are modeled using Generalized Extreme Value (GEV) distributions and a Gaussian copula for modelling the interdependence between variables. The statistical dependence between consecutive days is addressed by defining a climate-based extremal index for each weather type. This work allows attribution of extreme events to specific weather conditions, enhancing the knowledge of climate-driven coastal flooding.}

  abstract = {In recent decades, a striking number of countries have suffered from consecutive disasters: events whose impacts overlap both spatially and temporally, while recovery is still under way. The risk of consecutive disasters will increase due to growing exposure, the interconnectedness of human society, and the increased frequency and intensity of nontectonic hazard. This paper provides an overview of the different types of consecutive disasters, their causes, and impacts. The impacts can be distinctly different from disasters occurring in isolation (both spatially and temporally) from other disasters, noting that full isolation never occurs. We use existing empirical disaster databases to show the global probabilistic occurrence for selected hazard types. Current state-of-the art risk assessment models and their outputs do not allow for a thorough representation and analysis of consecutive disasters. This is mainly due to the many challenges that are introduced by addressing and combining hazards of different nature, and accounting for their interactions and dynamics. Disaster risk management needs to be more holistic and codesigned between researchers, policy makers, first responders, and companies.},

  abstract = {Providing sufficient, safe, and reliable drinking water is a growing challenge as water supplies become more scarce and uncertain. Meanwhile, water utilities in the United States lose approximately 17\% of their delivered water to leaks each year. Using data from over 800 utilities across four U.S. states, California, Georgia, Tennessee, and Texas, we characterize the heterogeneity in water losses across the U.S., develop a model to assess the economically efficient level of losses, and use this model to compare the net benefits of several proposed water loss regulations and modeling approaches. Combining economic and engineering principles, our model shows that for the median utility, it is economically efficient to reduce water losses by 34.7\%, or 100 acre-feet (AF) per year. The median cost of water savings from leak management is \$277/AF, which falls well below the cost of traditional water management tools. However, the optimal level of water losses strongly depends on utility-specific characteristics, leading to large differences in the potential for cost-effective leak reduction across utilities. We show that water loss management can lead to water savings that generate net economic benefits, but only if management approaches incorporate economic and engineering principles.}

In the wake of this event, there has been interest in understanding the degree to which this event was unusual and estimating the probability of experiencing a similar event in other locations. Additionally, researchers have aimed to better understand the ways in which the sea surface temperature (SST) in the Gulf of Mexico (GoM) is associated with precipitation extremes in this region. This work addresses all of these issues through the development of a multivariate spatial extreme value model. Our analysis indicates that warmer GoM SSTs are associated with higher precipitation extremes in the western Gulf Coast region during hurricane season and that the precipitation totals observed during Hurricane Harvey are less unusual based on the warm GoM SST in 2017. As SSTs in the GoM are expected to steadily increase over the remainder of this century, this analysis suggests that western Gulf Coast locations may experience more severe precipitation extremes during hurricane season.}

Net water flux cannot be directly measured, and its estimates as a residual of individual surface flux components often suffer from mass conservation errors due to accumulated systematic biases of individual fluxes. Here, for the first time, we provide direct estimates of global NWF based on near-surface satellite soil moisture retrievals from the Soil Moisture Ocean Salinity (SMOS) and Soil Moisture Active Passive (SMAP) satellites. We apply a recently developed analytical model derived via inversion of the linearized Richards' equation. The model is parsimonious, yet yields unbiased estimates of long-term cumulative NWF that is generally well correlated with the terrestrial water storage anomaly from the Gravity Recovery and Climate Experiment (GRACE) satellite. In addition, in conjunction with precipitation and evapotranspiration retrievals, the resultant NWF estimates provide a new means for retrieving global infiltration and runoff from satellite observations. However, the efficacy of the proposed approach over densely vegetated regions is questionable, due to the uncertainty of the satellite soil moisture retrievals and the lack of explicit parameterization of transpiration by deeply rooted plants in the proposed model. Future research is needed to advance this modeling paradigm to explicitly account for plant transpiration.},

  abstract = {Groundwater markets improve the agricultural economy by transferring water entitlements from low-efficient users to high-efficient ones to maximize productivity. Aiming at developing an efficient groundwater market, the environmental effects of the market mechanism should be assessed, and a reliable method for monitoring water consumption needs to be employed. Toward this end, this paper proposes three annual smart groundwater market mechanisms to maximize water net benefits, minimize groundwater withdrawal, and precisely measure water consumption in agricultural fields. To guarantee the aquifer's safe yield in each mechanism, a groundwater simulation model (i.e., Groundwater Modeling System (GMS)) is used to control groundwater table drawdown at the end of the planning horizon. In addition, the fields' evapotranspiration (ET) is estimated using Surface Energy Balance Algorithm for Land (SEBAL) and Mapping Evapo Transpiration at high Resolution with Internalized Calibration (METRIC) algorithm to measure the net groundwater consumption during the market. In this regard, we evaluated the algorithms' performances using observed data from a local lysimeter. They are applied to the Nough plain in Iran to assess the effectiveness of the proposed market framework. The findings illustrate their efficiency in recovering approximately 80\% (23.33 million cubic meters (MCM)) of groundwater loss due to overexploitation in the study area and increasing the users' annual benefits by 10.6\% compared to the non-market condition. In addition, results imply that the METRIC model approximates daily crop ET with a higher accuracy level than the SEBAL model with RMSE, MAE, and Percentage Error of 0.37~mm/day, 0.32~mm/day, and 14.92\%, respectively. This research revealed that the proposed market framework is a powerful tool for reallocating water entitlements and increasing water productivity in arid and semi-arid regions.}

  abstract = {With increasing focus on large-scale planning and allocation of resources for protection against future flood risk, it is necessary to analyze and improve the deficiencies in the existing flood modeling approach through a better understanding of the interactions among overland flow, subsurface flow, and river hydrodynamics. Recent studies have shown that it is possible to improve flood inundation modeling and mapping using physically based distributed models that incorporate the observable data through assimilation and simulate hydrologic fluxes using the fundamental laws of conservation of mass at multiple spatiotemporal scales. However, despite the significance of distributed modeling in hydrology, it has received relatively less attention within the context of flood hazards. While significant strides have been taken by the research community in estimating streamflow, surface-subsurface volumes, and soil moisture; predicting the flood depths and extents accurately across large scales remains a challenge for distributed models. This chapter addresses the challenges that exist within the flood modeling approach while advocating for a large-scale holistic approach that goes beyond streamflow prediction to provide flood inundation extents and depths. As the way forward, this chapter presents an overview of physically based distributed modeling by providing valuable insights into the essential characteristics of distributed models and highlighting the important factors that need to be considered for large-scale flood simulation. Finally, the chapter provides a prototype modeling framework for large-scale distributed flood modeling using the Interconnected Channel and Pond Routing (ICPR) model for the Wabash River Basin in the United States to illustrate how distributed models can be applied for flood inundation mapping for a large watershed.},

  abstract = {AbstractCurrent practice using probabilistic methods applied for designing hydraulic structures generally assume that extreme events are stationary. However, many studies in the past decades have shown that hydrological records exhibit some type of nonstationarity such as trends and shifts. Human intervention in river basins (e.g., urbanization), the effect of low-frequency climatic variability (e.g., Pacific Decadal Oscillation), and climate change due to increased greenhouse gasses in the atmosphere have been suggested to be the leading causes of changes in the hydrologic cycle of river basins in addition to changes in the magnitude and frequency of extreme floods and extreme sea levels. To tackle nonstationarity in hydrologic extremes, several approaches have been proposed in the literature such as frequency analysis, in which the parameters of a given model vary in accordance with time. The aim of this paper is to show that some basic concepts and methods used in designing flood-related hydraulic structures assuming a stationary world can be extended into a nonstationary framework. In particular, the concepts of return period and risk are formulated by extending the geometric distribution to allow for changing exceeding probabilities over time. Building on previous developments suggested in the statistical and climate change literature, the writers present a simple and unified framework to estimate the return period and risk for nonstationary hydrologic events along with examples and applications so that it can be accessible to a broad audience in the field. The applications demonstrate that the return period and risk estimates for nonstationary situations can be quite different than those corresponding to stationary conditions. They also suggest that the nonstationary analysis can be helpful in making an appropriate assessment of the risk of a hydraulic structure during the planned project-life.}

Practitioners can in principle describe the sensitivity pattern of a model Y=f(X1,X2,\ldots,Xk) with k uncertain input factors via a full decomposition of the variance V of Y into terms depending on the factors and their interactions. More often practitioners are satisfied with computing just k first order effects and k total effects, the latter describing synthetically interactions among input factors. In sensitivity analysis a key concern is the computational cost of the analysis, defined in terms of number of evaluations of f(X1,X2,\ldots,Xk) needed to complete the analysis, as f(X1,X2,\ldots,Xk) is often in the form of a numerical model which may take long processing time. While the computational cost is relatively cheap and weakly dependent on k for estimating first order effects, it remains expensive and strictly k-dependent for total effect indices. In the present note we compare existing and new practices for this index and offer recommendations on which to use.}

  abstract = {Catastrophe risk models used by the insurance industry are likely subject to significant uncertainty, but due to their proprietary nature and strict licensing conditions they are not available for experimentation. In addition, even if such experiments were conducted, these would not be repeatable by other researchers because commercial confidentiality issues prevent the details of proprietary catastrophe model structures from being described in public domain documents. However, such experimentation is urgently required to improve decision making in both insurance and reinsurance markets. In this paper we therefore construct our own catastrophe risk model for flooding in Dublin, Ireland, in order to assess the impact of typical precipitation data uncertainty on loss predictions. As we consider only a city region rather than a whole territory and have access to detailed data and computing resources typically unavailable to industry modellers, our model is significantly more detailed than most commercial products. The model consists of four components, a stochastic rainfall module, a hydrological and hydraulic flood hazard module, a vulnerability module, and a financial loss module. Using these we undertake a series of simulations to test the impact of driving the stochastic event generator with four different rainfall data sets: ground gauge data, gauge-corrected rainfall radar, meteorological reanalysis data (European Centre for Medium-Range Weather Forecasts Reanalysis-Interim; ERA-Interim) and a satellite rainfall product (The Climate Prediction Center morphing method; CMORPH). Catastrophe models are unusual because they use the upper three components of the modelling chain to generate a large synthetic database of unobserved and severe loss-driving events for which estimated losses are calculated. We find the loss estimates to be more sensitive to uncertainties propagated from the driving precipitation data sets than to other uncertainties in the hazard and vulnerability modules, suggesting that the range of uncertainty within catastrophe model structures may be greater than commonly believed.}

Our results show that our model can generalize from single-timestep predictions with thousands of particles during training, to different initial conditions, thousands of timesteps, and at least an order of magnitude more particles at test time. Our model was robust to hyperparameter choices across various evaluation metrics: the main determinants of long-term performance were the number of message-passing steps, and mitigating the accumulation of error by corrupting the training data with noise. Our GNS framework advances the state-of-the-art in learned physical simulation, and holds promise for solving a wide range of complex forward and inverse problems.},

  abstract = {As population levels protected by large dams have risen in the last decades, accurately assessing flood hazard and risk will become increasingly important for developing and sustaining flood mitigation policies. Recent research has shown that the degree of control and protection offered by retaining structures largely depend on their operation strategies. As such, now, more than ever, it is crucial to be prepared to operate a reservoir under extreme hydrological circumstances, when the consequences of an operational error could be very serious. However, the operation schedules currently use in the engineering practice lack on mechanisms for evaluating and balancing the potential risks associated with storage and release decisions. This results in reservoir flood control strategies that, from the perspective of flood risk mitigation, are distant from the optimal. This graduation project aims to improve existing methods for developing emergency operation schedules by including the concept of risk into the optimization of flood control operations. To address this topic, the research is divided into: (1) development of a methodology for including reservoir operation effects in the risk analysis of dam-reservoir systems; (2) combination of the risk analysis procedure with an optimization algorithm to devise optimal risk-based emergency operation schedules.\&lt;br/\&gt;\&lt;br/\&gt;The thesis culminates with a case study in which the emergency operations are optimized for the Barker Reservoir system in Houston, Texas. Susceptible to Hurricanes like Hurricane Harvey (2017) and intense precipitation events such as Tax Day (2016), the Barker system presents an operational dilemma requiring trade-offs between released flows and stored volumes. Using the methods developed in this thesis, the flood risk analysis shows that a change in the operational strategy would contribute greatly to reducing the total risk of the system. Under extreme hydrological events, an operation strategy with releases starting at the first stages of the flood event display a reduction of almost a 32\% on the total risk of the system as compared with the current operation strategy, including a 40\% decrease on the risk associated with the structural failure of the dam. The new operating policy, however, increases the frequency of downstream damages during non-structural low frequency failure scenarios. Therefore, an increase of the downstream channel capacity along Buffalo Bayou and adequate measures to strengthen the dam are further recommended to reduce downstream damaging flooding and diminish the failure probabilities of the structure.},

  abstract = {Existing needs to manage flood risk in the United States are underserved by available flood hazard information. This contributes to an alarming escalation of flood impacts amounting to hundreds of billions of dollars per year and countless disrupted lives and affected communities. Making information about flood hazards useful for the range of decisions that dictate the consequences of flooding poses many challenges. Here, we describe collaborative flood modeling, whereby researchers and end-users at two coastal sites co-develop fine-resolution flood hazard models and maps responsive to decision-making needs. We find, first of all, that resident perception and awareness of flooding are enhanced more by fine-resolution depth contour maps than Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) flood hazard classification maps and that viewing fine-resolution depth contour maps helps to minimize differences in flood perception across subgroups within the community, generating a shared understanding. We also find that collaborative flood modeling supports the engagement of a wide range of end-users in contemplating the risks of flooding and provides strong evidence that the co-produced knowledge can be readily adopted and applied for Flood Risk Management (FRM). Overall, collaborative flood modeling advances FRM by providing multiple points of entry for diverse groups of end-users to contemplate the spatial extent, intensity, timing, chance, and consequences of flooding, thus enabling the web of decision-making related to flooding to be better informed with the best available science. This transdisciplinary approach emphasizes vulnerability reduction and is complementary to FEMA Flood Insurance Rate Maps used for flood insurance administration.},

Events are rare by definition, and return periods of heavy precipitation events are often calculated assuming a stationary climate. Furthermore, ensembles of climate model projections are not large enough to fully categorize the tails of the distribution. To address this, we cluster the contiguous United States into self-similar hydroclimates to estimate changes in the expected frequency of extremely rare events under scenarios of global mean temperature change. We find that, although there is some regional variation, record events are projected in general to become more intense, with 500-year events intensifying by 10\textendash 50\% under 2 \textdegree C of warming and by 40\textendash 100\% under 4 \textdegree C of warming. This analysis could provide information to inform regional prioritization of resources to improve the resilience of U.S. infrastructure.}

In particular, annual maxima over space and time are assumed to follow generalized extreme value (GEV) distributions, with parameters {$\mu$}, {$\sigma$}, and {$\xi$} specified in the latent stage to reflect underlying spatio-temporal structure. The~novelty here is that we relax the conditionally independence assumption in the first stage of the hierarchial model, an assumption which has been adopted in previous work. This assumption implies that realizations of the the surface of spatial maxima will be everywhere discontinuous. For many phenomena including, e.g., temperature and precipitation, this behavior is inappropriate. Instead, we offer a spatial process model for extreme values that provides mean square continuous realizations, where the behavior of the surface is driven by the spatial dependence which is unexplained under the latent spatio-temporal specification for the GEV parameters. In this sense, the first stage smoothing is viewed as fine scale or short range smoothing while the larger scale smoothing will be captured in the second stage of the modeling. In addition, as would be desired, we are able to implement spatial interpolation for extreme values based on this model. A simulation study and a study on actual annual maximum rainfall for a region in South Africa are used to illustrate the performance of the model.}

This tailings dam failure was only the most recent in a long list of catastrophic tailings dam accidents (see the first figure) (2, 3). Similar accidents also occur at electric power stations, where ponds are used to store coal combustion residuals such as fly and bottom ash. There are about 1000 operating ash ponds in the United States (4), and coal consumption patterns suggest that there may be more than 9000 worldwide. The catastrophic accident at the Kingston fossil power plant in Tennessee in 2008 (5) highlights the destructive potential of ash pond failures. Detailed analysis of tailings dam and ash pond failures shows that little-understood processes such as time-delayed triggering mechanisms are more likely to manifest when best engineering practices are disregarded.

This study integrates information from a number of sources to describe the frequency, causes, and effects of these releases in order to inform analysis of risk from future hurricanes. Over 200 onshore releases of hazardous chemicals, petroleum, or natural gas were reported. Storm surge was responsible for the majority of petroleum releases and failure of storage tanks was the most common mechanism of release. Of the smaller number of hazardous chemical releases reported, many were associated with flaring from plant startup, shutdown, or process upset. In areas impacted by storm surge, 10\% of the facilities within the Risk Management Plan (RMP) and Toxic Release Inventory (TRI) databases and 28\% of SIC 1311 facilities experienced accidental releases. In areas subject only to hurricane strength winds, a lower fraction (1\% of RMP and TRI and 10\% of SIC 1311 facilities) experienced a release while 1\% of all facility types reported a release in areas that experienced tropical storm strength winds. Of industrial facilities surveyed, more experienced indirect disruptions such as displacement of workers, loss of electricity and communication systems, and difficulty acquiring supplies and contractors for operations or reconstruction (55\%), than experienced releases. To reduce the risk of hazardous material releases and speed the return to normal operations under these difficult conditions, greater attention should be devoted to risk-based facility design and improved prevention and response planning.},

  abstract = {'Tis the seasonal Anthropogenic climate change has become clearly observable through many metrics. These include an increase in global annual temperatures, growing heat content of the oceans, and sea level rise owing to the melting of the polar ice sheets and glaciers. Now, Santer et al. report that a human-caused signal in the seasonal cycle of tropospheric temperature can also be measured (see the Perspective by Randel). They use satellite data and the anthropogenic ``fingerprint'' predicted by climate models to show the extent of the effects and discuss how these changes have been caused. Science, this issue p. eaas8806; see also p. 227 Structured Abstract INTRODUCTIONFingerprint studies use pattern information to separate human and natural influences on climate. Most fingerprint research relies on patterns of climate change that are averaged over years or decades. Few studies probe shorter time scales. We consider here whether human influences are identifiable in the changing seasonal cycle. We focus on Earth's troposphere, which extends from the surface to roughly 16 km at the tropics and 13 km at the poles. Our interest is in TAC, the geographical pattern of the amplitude of the annual cycle of tropospheric temperature. Information on how TAC has changed over time is available from satellite retrievals and from large multimodel ensembles of simulations. RATIONALEAt least three lines of evidence suggest that human activities have affected the seasonal cycle. First, there are seasonal signals in certain human-caused external forcings, such as stratospheric ozone depletion and particulate pollution. Second, there is seasonality in some of the climate feedbacks triggered by external forcings. Third, there are widespread signals of seasonal changes in the distributions and abundances of plant and animal species. These biological signals are in part mediated by seasonal climate changes arising from global warming. All three lines of evidence provide scientific justification for performing fingerprint studies with the seasonal cycle. RESULTSThe simulated response of the seasonal cycle to historical changes in human and natural factors has prominent mid-latitude increases in the amplitude of TAC. These features arise from larger mid-latitude warming in the summer hemisphere, which appears to be partly attributable to continental drying. Because of land-ocean differences in heat capacity and hemispheric asymmetry in land fraction, mid-latitude increases in TAC are greater in the Northern Hemisphere than in the Southern Hemisphere. Qualitatively similar large-scale patterns of annual cycle change occur in satellite tropospheric temperature data.We applied a standard fingerprint method to determine (i) whether the pattern similarity between the model ``human influence'' fingerprint and satellite temperature data increases with time, and (ii) whether such an increase is significant relative to random changes in similarity between the fingerprint and patterns of natural internal variability. This method yields signal-to-noise (S/N) ratios as a function of increasing satellite record length. Fingerprint detection occurs when S/N exceeds and remains above the 1\% significance threshold.We find that the model fingerprint of externally forced seasonal cycle changes is identifiable with high statistical confidence in five out of six satellite temperature datasets. In these five datasets, S/N ratios for the 38-year satellite record vary from 2.7 to 5.8. Our positive fingerprint detection results are unaffected by the removal of all global mean information and by the exclusion of sea ice regions. On time scales for which meaningful tests are possible (one to two decades), there is no evidence that S/N ratios are spuriously inflated by a systematic model underestimate of the amplitude of observed tropospheric temperature variability. CONCLUSIONOur results suggest that attribution studies with the seasonal cycle of tropospheric temperature provide powerful and novel evidence for a statistically significant human effect on Earth's climate. We hope that this finding will stimulate more detailed exploration of the seasonal signals caused by anthropogenic forcing. {$<$}img class="fragment-image" aria-describedby="F1-caption" src="https://science-sciencemag-org.ezproxy.cul.columbia.edu/content/sci/361/6399/eaas8806/F1.medium.gif"/{$>$} Download high-res image Open in new tab Download Powerpoint Trends in the amplitude of the annual cycle of tropospheric temperature.Trends are calculated over 1979 to 2016 and are averages from a large multimodel ensemble of historical simulations. The most prominent features are pronounced mid-latitude increases in annual cycle amplitude (shown in red) in both hemispheres. Similar mid-latitude increases occur in satellite temperature data. Trends are superimposed on NASA's ``blue marble'' image. We provide scientific evidence that a human-caused signal in the seasonal cycle of tropospheric temperature has emerged from the background noise of natural variability. Satellite data and the anthropogenic ``fingerprint'' predicted by climate models show common large-scale changes in geographical patterns of seasonal cycle amplitude. These common features include increases in amplitude at mid-latitudes in both hemispheres, amplitude decreases at high latitudes in the Southern Hemisphere, and small changes in the tropics. Simple physical mechanisms explain these features. The model fingerprint of seasonal cycle changes is identifiable with high statistical confidence in five out of six satellite temperature datasets. Our results suggest that attribution studies with the changing seasonal cycle provide powerful evidence for a significant human effect on Earth's climate. Human activity is causing changes in the seasonal cycle of tropospheric temperature. Human activity is causing changes in the seasonal cycle of tropospheric temperature.},

  abstract = {Several methods can be employed to evaluate investment in energy production. On one hand, traditional methods (Net Present Value (NPV) or Internal Rate of Return (IRR), for example) ignore certain project characteristics that may influence its evaluation, such as irreversibility, uncertainty and management flexibility. Nevertheless, the Real Option Approach (ROA) has an advantage over the application of traditional methods, since the prior uncertainties are taken into account. Thus, the main objective of this study is to apply ROA to a case-study (mini-hydro plant) through the use of the binomial tree developed by Cox, Ross and Rubinstein in 1979. This study concludes that the value of ROA is higher than the value of NPV because the investor can get better information and uncertainty is reduced when he has the option to defer the investment. In addition to providing a deep analysis on the major gaps in energy investment evaluation, this work contributes to a better understanding of the usefulness of ROA.}

  abstract = {The difficulties faced by existing multiobjective evolutionary algorithms (MOEAs) in handling many-objective problems relate to the inefficiency of selection operators, high computational cost, and difficulty in visualization of objective space. While many approaches aim to counter these difficulties by increasing the fidelity of the standard selection operators, the objective reduction approach attempts to eliminate objectives that are not essential to describe the Pareto-optimal front (POF). If the number of essential objectives is found to be two or three, the problem could be solved by the existing MOEAs. It implies that objective reduction could make an otherwise unsolvable (many-objective) problem solvable. Even when the essential objectives are four or more, the reduced representation of the problem will have favorable impact on the search efficiency, computational cost, and decision-making. Hence, development of generic and robust objective reduction approaches becomes important. This paper presents a principal component analysis and maximum variance unfolding based framework for linear and nonlinear objective reduction algorithms, respectively. The major contribution of this paper includes: 1) the enhancements in the core components of the framework for higher robustness in terms of applicability to a range of problems with disparate degree of redundancy; mechanisms to handle input data that poorly approximates the true POF; and dependence on fewer parameters to minimize the variability in performance; 2) proposition of an error measure to assess the quality of results; 3) sensitivity analysis of the proposed algorithms for the critical parameter involved, and the characteristics of the input data; and 4) study of the performance of the proposed algorithms vis-\`a-vis dominance relation preservation based algorithms, on a wide range of test problems (scaled up to 50 objectives) and two real-world problems.}

In doing so, new indices of neighbourhood flood vulnerability and social flood risk are introduced and used to provide a quantitative comparison of the flood risks faced by more and less socially vulnerable neighbourhoods. The results show the concentrated nature of geographic flood disadvantage. For example, ten local authorities account for 50\% of the most socially vulnerable people that live in flood prone areas. The results also highlight the systematic nature of flood disadvantage. For example, flood risks are higher in socially vulnerable communities than elsewhere; this is shown to be particularly the case in coastal areas, economically struggling cities, and dispersed rural communities. Results from a re-analysis of the Environment Agency's Long-Term Investment Scenarios (for England) suggest a long-term economic case for improving the protection afforded to the most socially vulnerable communities; a finding that reinforces the need to develop a better understanding of flood risk in socially vulnerable communities if flood risk management efforts are to deliver fair outcomes. In response to these findings, the paper advocates an approach to flood risk management that emphasises Rawlsian principles of preferentially targeting risk reduction for the most socially vulnerable and avoids a process of prioritisation based upon strict utilitarian or purely egalitarian principles.}

  abstract = {This paper aims at serving as a critical analysis of Real Options (RO) methodologies that have so far been applied to the flexible evaluation of smart grid developments and as a practical guide to understanding the benefits but more importantly the limitations of RO methodologies. Hence, future research could focus on developing more practical RO tools for application to the energy industry, thus making the utilization of powerful ``real options thinking'' for decision making under uncertainty more widespread. This is particularly important for applications in low carbon power and energy systems with increasing renewable and sustainable energy resources, given the different types of uncertainty they are facing in the transition towards a truly Smart Grid. In order to do so, and based on an extensive relevant literature review, the analogies with financial options are first presented, with various assumptions and their validity being clearly discussed in order to understand if, when, and how specific methods can be applied. It is then argued how option theory is in most cases not directly applicable to investment in energy systems but requires the consideration of their physical characteristics. The paper finally gives recommendations for building practical RO approaches to energy system (and potentially all engineering) project investments under uncertainty, regardless of the scale, time frame, or type of uncertainty involved.}

This paper summarizes the contribution of their authors to a few strategic studies, research workshops, development forum and international conferences related to Climate and Energy. It presents a review of the impacts that climate change may have throughout the energy chain and identifies current knowledge gaps and areas for future research development. One of the greatest challenges is how to assess impacts which may occur as a consequence of the projected increase in the intensity of extreme weather events: the majority of current methodologies rely on past experience but this may not be a sufficiently good guide for planning and operational activities in the coming decades. Also, climate impact assessments on energy planning and operation need to take into account a greater number of scenarios, as well as investigate impacts on particular energy segments. Therefore, we identify energy segments for which little climate impact research has been conducted. Finally, because climate impact assessment for energy systems is a relatively new research field, it is expected that methodological developments will increase in the near future with a consequent broadening of the knowledge base on the subject.}

We use prioritized experience replay in Deep Q-Networks (DQN), a reinforcement learning algorithm that achieved human-level performance across many Atari games.

Here we used new hydrography datasets and found that small ponds, depending on their spatial position within both their local catchments and the larger river network, can dominate the retention of nitrogen, phosphorus, and sediment compared to rivers, lakes, and reservoirs. Over 300,000 small ponds are collectively responsible for 34\%, 69\%, and 12\% of the mean annual retention of nitrogen, phosphorus, and sediment in the Northeastern United States, respectively, with a dominant influence in headwater catchments (54\%, 85\%, and 50\%, respectively). Small ponds play a critical role among the many aquatic features in long-term nutrient and sediment loading to downstream waters.},

  abstract = {This paper compares six statistical downscaling models (SDMs) and three regional climate models (RCMs) in their ability to downscale daily precipitation statistics in a region of complex topography. The six SDMs include regression methods, weather typing methods, a conditional weather generator, and a bias correction and spatial disaggregation approach. The comparison is carried out over the European Alps for current and future (2071\textendash 2100) climate. The evaluation of simulated precipitation for the current climate shows that the SDMs and RCMs tend to have similar biases but that they differ with respect to interannual variations. The SDMs strongly underestimate the magnitude of the year-to-year variations. Clear differences emerge also with respect to the year-to-year anomaly correlation skill: In winter, over complex terrain, the better RCMs achieve significantly higher skills than the SDMs. Over flat terrain and in summer, the differences are smaller. Scenario results using A2 emissions show that in winter mean precipitation tends to increase north of about 45\textdegree N and insignificant or opposite changes are found to the south. There is good agreement between the downscaling models for most precipitation statistics. In summer, there is still good qualitative agreement between the RCMs but large differences between the SDMs and between the SDMs and the RCMs. According to the RCMs, there is a strong trend toward drier conditions including longer periods of drought. The SDMs, on the other hand, show mostly nonsignificant or even opposite changes. Overall, the present analysis suggests that downscaling does significantly contribute to the uncertainty in regional climate scenarios, especially for the summer precipitation climate.},

Probabilistic modeling encompasses a wide range of methods that explicitly describe uncertainty using probability distributions. Three widely used probabilistic models implemented in pomegranate are general mixture models, hidden Markov models, and Bayesian networks. A primary focus of pomegranate is to abstract away the complexities of training models from their definition. This allows users to focus on specifying the correct model for their application instead of being limited by their understanding of the underlying algorithms. An aspect of this focus involves the collection of additive sufficient statistics from data sets as a strategy for training models. This approach trivially enables many useful learning strategies, such as out-of-core learning, minibatch learning, and semi-supervised learning, without requiring the user to consider how to partition data or modify the algorithms to handle these tasks themselves. pomegranate is written in Cython to speed up calculations and releases the global interpreter lock to allow for built-in multithreaded parallelism, making it competitive with--or outperform--other implementations of similar algorithms. This paper presents an overview of the design choices in pomegranate, and how they have enabled complex features to be supported by simple code.

The focus is on assessing the impact on precipitation of sea surface temperature (SST) anomalies, land conditions, and large-scale atmospheric modes of variability. A key result is that the April record-breaking precipitation in the Ohio River valley was primarily the result of the unforced development of a positive North Atlantic Oscillation (NAO)-like mode of variability with unusually large amplitude, limiting the predictability of the precipitation in that region at 1-month leads. SST forcing (La Ni\~na conditions) contributed to the broader continental-scale pattern of precipitation anomalies, producing drying in the southern plains and weak wet anomalies in the northeast, while the impact of realistic initial North American land conditions was to enhance precipitation in the upper Midwest and produce deficits in the Southeast. It was further found that 1) the 1 March atmospheric initial condition was the primary source of the ensemble mean precipitation response over the eastern United States in April (well beyond the limit of weather predictability), suggesting an influence on the initial state of the previous SST forcing and/or troposphericstratospheric coupling linked to an unusually persistent and cold polar vortex; and 2) stationary wave model experiments suggest that the SST-forced base state for April enhanced the amplitude of the NAO response compared to that of the climatological state, though the impact is modest and can be of either sign.}

The new methods, which we call proximal policy optimization (PPO), have some of the benefits of trust region policy optimization (TRPO), but they are much simpler to implement, more general, and have better sample complexity (empirically). Our experiments test PPO on a collection of benchmark tasks, including simulated robotic locomotion and Atari game playing, and we show that PPO outperforms other online policy gradient methods, and overall strikes a favorable balance between sample complexity, simplicity, and wall-time.},

  abstract = {Abstract Changes in precipitation variability can have large societal consequences, whether at the short time scales of flash floods or the longer time scales of multiyear droughts. Recent studies have suggested that in future climate projections, precipitation variability rises more steeply than does its mean, leading to concerns about societal impacts. This work evaluates changes in mean precipitation over a broad range of spatial and temporal scales using a range of models from high-resolution regional simulations to millennial-scale global simulations. Results show that changes depend on the scale of aggregation and involve strong regional differences. On local scales that resolve individual rainfall events (hours and tens of kilometers), changes in precipitation distributions are complex and variances rise substantially more than means, as is required given the well-known disproportionate rise in precipitation intensity. On scales that aggregate across many events, distributional changes become simpler and variability changes smaller. At regional scale, future precipitation distributions can be largely reproduced by a simple transformation of present-day precipitation involving a multiplicative shift and a small additive term. The ``extra'' broadening is negatively correlated with changes in mean precipitation: in strongly ``wetting'' areas, distributions broaden less than expected from a simple multiplicative mean change; in ``drying'' areas, distributions narrow less. Precipitation variability changes are therefore of especial concern in the subtropics, which tend to dry under climate change. Outside the tropics, variability changes are similar on time scales from days to decades (i.e., show little frequency dependence). This behavior is highly robust across models, suggesting it may stem from some fundamental constraint.}

  abstract = {Flooding is a function of hydrologic, climatologic, and land use characteristics. However, the relative contribution of these factors to flood risk over the long-term is uncertain. In response to this knowledge gap, this study quantifies how urbanization and climatological trends influenced flooding in the greater Houston region during Hurricane Harvey. The region\textemdash characterized by extreme precipitation events, low topographic relief, and clay-dominated soils\textemdash is naturally flood prone, but it is also one of the fastest growing urban areas in the United States. This rapid growth has contributed to increased runoff volumes and rates in areas where anthropogenic climate changes has also been shown to be contributing to extreme precipitation. To disentangle the relative contributions of urban development and climatic changes on flooding during Hurricane Harvey, we simulate catchment response using a spatially-distributed hydrologic model under 1900 and 2017 conditions. This approach provides insight into how timing, volume, and peak discharge in response to Harvey-like events have evolved over more than a century. Results suggest that over the past century, urban development and climate change have had a large impact on peak discharge at stream gauges in the Houston region, where development alone has increased peak discharges by 54\% ({$\pm$}28\%) and climate change has increased peak discharge by about 20\% ({$\pm$}3\%). When combined, urban development and climate change nearly doubled peak discharge (84\% {$\pm$}35\%) in the Houston area during Harvey compared to a similar event in 1900, suggesting that land use change has magnified the effects of climate change on catchment response. The findings support a precautionary approach to flood risk management that explicitly considers how current land use decisions may impact future conditions under varying climate trends, particularly in low-lying coastal cities.}

In this paper, we demonstrate the ability of the recently developed Super-Fast INundation of CoastS (SFINCS) model to delineate the depth and extent of flooding during Hurricane Harvey in Houston, Texas. The model was validated against water level time-series at twenty-one United States Geological Survey (USGS) observation points and 115 high water mark locations. FEMA depth-damage curves were used to estimate building and content damages from the combined flood sources (e.g., pluvial, fluvial, and marine) and total losses are compared against insurance claims registered with the U.S. National Flood Insurance Program (NFIP) and a depth grid produced during the U.S. Federal Emergency Management Agency's (FEMA) Preliminary Damage Assessment (PDA). The results suggest that Harvey may have caused upwards of \$8.3 billion USD in uninsured residential loss within the model domain. Comparison against FEMA's PDA indicates that the SFINCS model predicts much larger total losses, indicating that the incorporation of spatially-distributed pluvial hazards into the modeling method is critical for identifying high-risk areas and supports the need for further flood risk analyses in the region.}

However, these studies are computationally expensive and often neglect to consider the flooding that arises from the combined hazards of precipitation and storm surge in coastal watersheds. This paper describes a method to stochastically simulate a large number of combinations of peak storm surge and cumulative precipitation to determine the hydraulic boundary conditions for a low-lying coastal watershed draining into a semi-enclosed tidal bay. The method is computationally efficient and takes into consideration five tropical cyclone characteristics at landfall: windspeed, angle of approach, landfall location, radius of maximum winds, and forward speed. A precipitation gage network and tidal gage data were used, along with observations from over 300 tropical cyclones in the Gulf of Mexico. A Non-parametric Bayesian Network was built to generate 100,000 synthetic storm events and used as input to an empirical wind set-up model to simulate storm surge within a tidal bay and at the downstream boundary of the watershed. Based on the results, probable combinations of cumulative precipitation and peak storm surge for the watershed during hurricane conditions are determined. These boundary conditions can be easily incorporated into a coastal riverine model to determine flood risk in the watershed.}

Yet, equity remains largely outside of standard water resources planning and management practices. Inclusion of equity within water resources infrastructure is inhibited by barriers including an incomplete conceptual understanding of equity, a perceived lack of quantitative and qualitative equity metrics, unclear connections between equity and standard project planning frameworks, and the absence of concrete examples. To facilitate greater practical inclusion of social equity in water resources practices, we describe equity relative to dimensions of distribution, procedure, and recognition and identify metrics associated with each. We then map these dimensions of equity onto different stages of a water resources project life cycle. We discuss how inequities are often perpetuated by current approaches and highlight case studies that promote one or more of the facets of equity. Rather than providing a prescriptive solution to ``achieve'' equity within water resources practices, we emphasize the need for contextualized approaches that include pragmatic steps toward more equitable practices and outcomes.}

  abstract = {The Andes Cordillera produces a significant disruption to the structure and evolution of the weather systems that cross South America. In particular, cold fronts tend to be ``channeled'' to the north immediately to the east of the Andes, fostering the advance of cold air incursions (cold surges) well into subtropical, and sometimes tropical, latitudes. In contrast, active cold fronts hardly reach subtropical latitudes along the western side of the Andes (Pacific sea border). Instead, as a cold front moves equatorward along the east side of the Andes, a marked low-level warming tends to appear along the west side of the subtropical Andes, leading to the formation of a mesoscale coastal low (or trough) in this region. To further understand the processes that lead to a contrasting evolution of the cold front at each side of the Andes, a typical frontal passage is studied in this work, using synoptic observations and a regional model [Eta\textendash Centro de Previs\~ao de Tempo e Estudos Clim\'aticos (CPTEC)] simulation. The passage of the postfrontal anticyclone over southern South America produces a poleward-pointing pressure gradient and, hence, geostrophic easterly flow at low levels. The tall and steep mountains block the flow, leading to a very small zonal wind component close to the slopes. Convergence (divergence) of the zonal flow to the east (west) of the subtropical Andes is largely compensated for by upward (downward) motion, and the associated cooling (warming) over this region. The weak zonal wind component near the Andes also breaks down the geostrophic balance over this region, giving rise to an acceleration of the southerly winds (i.e., along-barrier flow) and the consequent increase in cold advection. Therefore, to the east of the subtropical Andes both horizontal and vertical advection cool the lower troposphere, fostering the equatorward propagation of the cold front. To the west of the Andes, horizontal advection is largely offset by the strong warming associated with the enhanced subsidence over that region hindering the advance of the cold front into subtropical latitudes.}

  abstract = {Dynamical systems in nature exhibit self-similar fractal space\textendash time fluctuations on all scales indicating long-range correlations and, therefore, the statistical normal distribution with implicit assumption of independence, fixed mean and standard deviation cannot be used for description and quantification of fractal data sets. The author has developed a general systems theory based on classical statistical physics for fractal fluctuations which predicts the following. (1) The fractal fluctuations signify an underlying eddy continuum, the larger eddies being the integrated mean of enclosed smaller-scale fluctuations. (2) The probability distribution of eddy amplitudes and the variance (square of eddy amplitude) spectrum of fractal fluctuations follow the universal Boltzmann inverse power law expressed as a function of the golden mean. (3) Fractal fluctuations are signatures of quantum-like chaos since the additive amplitudes of eddies when squared represent probability densities analogous to the sub-atomic dynamics of quantum systems such as the photon or electron. (4) The model predicted distribution is very close to statistical normal distribution for moderate events within two standard deviations from the mean but exhibits a fat long tail that are associated with hazardous extreme events. Continuous periodogram power spectral analyses of available GHCN annual total rainfall time series for the period 1900\textendash 2008 for Indian and USA stations show that the power spectra and the corresponding probability distributions follow model predicted universal inverse power law form signifying an eddy continuum structure underlying the observed inter-annual variability of rainfall. On a global scale, man-made greenhouse gas related atmospheric warming would result in intensification of natural climate variability, seen immediately in high frequency fluctuations such as QBO and ENSO and even shorter timescales. Model concepts and results of analyses are discussed with reference to possible prediction of climate change. Model concepts, if correct, rule out unambiguously, linear trends in climate. Climate change will only be manifested as increase or decrease in the natural variability. However, more stringent tests of model concepts and predictions are required before applications to such an important issue as climate change. Observations and simulations with climate models show that precipitation extremes intensify in response to a warming climate (O'Gorman in Curr Clim Change Rep 1:49\textendash 59, 2015).}

In this study we have evaluated the role of LDES in decarbonized electricity systems and identified the cost and efficiency performance necessary for LDES to substantially reduce electricity costs and displace firm low-carbon generation. Our findings show that energy storage capacity cost and discharge efficiency are the most important performance parameters. Charge/discharge capacity cost and charge efficiency play secondary roles. Energy capacity costs must be {$\leq$}US\$20\,kWh\textendash 1 to reduce electricity costs by {$\geq$}10\%. With current electricity demand profiles, energy capacity costs must be {$\leq$}US\$1\,kWh\textendash 1 to fully displace all modelled firm low-carbon generation technologies. Electrification of end uses in a northern latitude context makes full displacement of firm generation more challenging and requires performance combinations unlikely to be feasible with known LDES technologies. Finally, LDES systems with the greatest impact on electricity cost and firm generation have storage durations exceeding 100\,h.},

Climate change projections for this region point to a warming trend, particularly in the inland subtropics; frequent occurrence of extreme heat events; increasing aridity; and changes in rainfall\textemdash with a particularly pronounced decline in southern Africa and an increase in East Africa. The region could also experience as much as one meter of sea-level rise by the end of this century under a 4~\textdegree C warming scenario. Sub-Saharan Africa's already high rates of undernutrition and infectious disease can be expected to increase compared to a scenario without climate change. Particularly vulnerable to these climatic changes are the rainfed agricultural systems on which the livelihoods of a large proportion of the region's population currently depend. As agricultural livelihoods become more precarious, the rate of rural\textendash urban migration may be expected to grow, adding to the already significant urbanization trend in the region. The movement of people into informal settlements may expose them to a variety of risks different but no less serious than those faced in their place of origin, including outbreaks of infectious disease, flash flooding and food price increases. Impacts across sectors are likely to amplify the overall effect but remain little understood.}

  abstract = {The increasing effort to develop and apply nonstationary models in hydrologic frequency analyses under changing environmental conditions can be frustrated when the additional uncertainty related to the model complexity is accounted for along with the sampling uncertainty. In order to show the practical implications and possible problems of using nonstationary models and provide critical guidelines, in this study we review the main tools developed in this field (such as nonstationary distribution functions, return periods, and risk of failure) highlighting advantages and disadvantages. The discussion is supported by three case studies that revise three illustrative examples reported in the scientific and technical literature referring to the Little Sugar Creek (at Charlotte, North Carolina), Red River of the North (North Dakota/Minnesota), and the Assunpink Creek (at Trenton, New Jersey). The uncertainty of the results is assessed by complementing point estimates with confidence intervals (CIs) and emphasizing critical aspects such as the subjectivity affecting the choice of the models' structure. Our results show that (1) nonstationary frequency analyses should not only be based on at-site time series but require additional information and detailed exploratory data analyses (EDA); (2) as nonstationary models imply that the time-varying model structure holds true for the entire future design life period, an appropriate modeling strategy requires that EDA identifies a well-defined deterministic mechanism leading the examined process; (3) when the model structure cannot be inferred in a deductive manner and nonstationary models are fitted by inductive inference, model structure introduces an additional source of uncertainty so that the resulting nonstationary models can provide no practical enhancement of the credibility and accuracy of the predicted extreme quantiles, whereas possible model misspecification can easily lead to physically inconsistent results; (4) when the model structure is uncertain, stationary models and a suitable assessment of the uncertainty accounting for possible temporal persistence should be retained as more theoretically coherent and reliable options for practical applications in real-world design and management problems; (5) a clear understanding of the actual probabilistic meaning of stationary and nonstationary return periods and risk of failure is required for a correct risk assessment and communication.}

  abstract = {The detection and attribution of long-term patterns in hydrological time series have been important research topics for decades. A significant portion of the literature regards such patterns as `deterministic components' or `trends' even though the complexity of hydrological systems does not allow easy deterministic explanations and attributions. Consequently, trend estimation techniques have been developed to make and justify statements about tendencies in the historical data, which are often used to predict future events. Testing trend hypothesis on observed time series is widespread in the hydro-meteorological literature mainly due to the interest in detecting consequences of human activities on the hydrological cycle. This analysis usually relies on the application of some null hypothesis significance tests (NHSTs) for slowly-varying and/or abrupt changes, such as Mann-Kendall, Pettitt, or similar, to summary statistics of hydrological time series (e.g., annual averages, maxima, minima, etc.). However, the reliability of this application has seldom been explored in detail. This paper discusses misuse, misinterpretation, and logical flaws of NHST for trends in the analysis of hydrological data from three different points of view: historic-logical, semantic-epistemological, and practical. Based on a review of NHST rationale, and basic statistical definitions of stationarity, nonstationarity, and ergodicity, we show that even if the empirical estimation of trends in hydrological time series is always feasible from a numerical point of view, it is uninformative and does not allow the inference of nonstationarity without assuming a priori additional information on the underlying stochastic process, according to deductive reasoning. This prevents the use of trend NHST outcomes to support nonstationary frequency analysis and modeling. We also show that the correlation structures characterizing hydrological time series might easily be underestimated, further compromising the attempt to draw conclusions about trends spanning the period of records. Moreover, even though adjusting procedures accounting for correlation have been developed, some of them are insufficient or are applied only to some tests, while some others are theoretically flawed but still widely applied. In particular, using 250 unimpacted stream flow time series across the conterminous United States (CONUS), we show that the test results can dramatically change if the sequences of annual values are reproduced starting from daily stream flow records, whose larger sizes enable a more reliable assessment of the correlation structures.}

The 20132014 precipitation deficits were more concentrated in the state of S\~ao Paulo, while in 20142015 moderate deficits were seen throughout the region. We find that a persistent warm sea surface temperature (SST) anomaly in the western tropical Pacific Ocean was an important driver of drought via atmospheric teleconnection in the two DecemberFebruary seasons. The warm SST and associated convective heating initiated a wave train across the South Pacific. The resulting anticyclonic geopotential height anomaly over the southwest Atlantic expanded the westward margin of the South Atlantic high and prevented low-pressure systems from entering southeast Brazil from midlatitudes. This mechanism suggests a hemispheric symmetry to that proposed for the recent California drought.}

The method is called Bayesian melding, and extends a previous method developed for macrolevel deterministic simulation models to agent-based stochastic models. It encodes all the available information about model inputs and outputs in terms of prior probability distributions and likelihoods, and uses Bayes's theorem to obtain the resulting posterior distribution of any quantity of interest that is a function of model inputs and/or outputs. It is Monte Carlo based, and quite easy to implement. We applied it to the projection of future household numbers by traffic activity zone in Eugene-Springfield, Oregon, using the UrbanSim model developed at the University of Washington. We compared it with a simpler method that uses repeated runs of the model with fixed estimated inputs. We found that the simple repeated runs method gave distributions of quantities of interest that were too narrow, while Bayesian melding gave well calibrated uncertainty statements.}

We investigate the uncertainty about the future effects of tearing down the Alaskan Way Viaduct in downtown Seattle, using an integrated model of housing, jobs, land use and transportation, on outcomes including average commute times. Our methodology combines the urban simulation model UrbanSim with the regional transportation model. We assess uncertainty using Bayesian melding, yielding a full predictive distribution of average commute times on 22 different routes in 2020. Of these routes, 14 do not include the viaduct and eight do. For the 14 base routes that do not include the viaduct, the predictive distributions overlap substantially, and so there is no indication that removing the viaduct would increase commute times for these routes. For each of the eight routes that do include the viaduct, the 95\% predictive interval for the difference in average travel times between the two scenarios includes zero, so there is not strong statistical support for the conclusion that removing the viaduct would lead to any increase in travel times. However, the median predicted increase is positive for each of these routes, with an average of 6min, suggesting that there may be some measurable increase in travel time for drivers that use the viaduct as a core component of their commute.}

This is consistent with the fact electric heating has similarly increased over the past 20 years in Texas. We find during the February 2021 event, average electricity demand was 8\% higher, and approximately 10,000 MW higher during the peak hour, than it would have been had temperature sensitivity remained unchanged at early 2000s levels. Our results highlight that Texas's increased sensitivity to cold weather extremes is not limited to the supply side, but the demand side as well. These findings have implications to other regions that are seeking to reduce carbon emissions through the electrification of heating.}

To obtain {$\sim$}80\% reliability, solar-heavy wind/solar generation mixes require sufficient energy storage to overcome the daily solar cycle, whereas wind-heavy wind/solar generation mixes require continental-scale transmission to exploit the geographic diversity of wind. Policy and planning aimed at providing a reliable electricity supply must therefore rigorously consider constraints associated with the geophysical variability of the solar and wind resource\textemdash even over continental scales.}

Stormwater management combined with urban design can be the best solution to minimize urban flooding risks and promote a clean natural environment. Green infrastructure (GI) is an environmentally sustainable alternative to traditional methods of stormwater management. Rain gardens, a GI, play a vital role in reducing rainwater volume and flow, prevent asset's destruction, remove pollutants from urban runoff, and recharge groundwater. Rain gardens can remove sediments, heavy metals, pathogens, nutrients, hydrocarbons from stormwater via several mechanisms. Various amendments in soil media help in delayed saturation, low sorption capacity, limited pollutant mobility, and bioaccumulation/biotransformation of metals/organic compounds in rain gardens. Soil media and plants play a vital role in the pollutant removal processes of rain gardens. Various plant-based mechanisms and chemical processes like adsorption, reduction, sedimentation, cation-exchange capacity, complexation, and so forth are involved in the removal of contaminants from stormwater. Construction and design considerations; different models of rain gardens; working mechanisms; performance assessment tools like capacity tests and synthetic runoff tests; removal of stormwater pollutants, and biphasic rain gardens have been critically discussed in this review. The state-of-the-art review approaches to provide fundamental knowledge of rain gardens and in-depth analyzes its potential as a stormwater management tool. Future directions on improving efficiencies of rain gardens have also been discussed for prospective researchers. This article is categorized under: Engineering Water}

  abstract = {Floods drive dynamic and deeply uncertain risks for people and infrastructures. Uncertainty characterization is a crucial step in improving the predictive understanding of multi-sector dynamics and the design of risk-management strategies. Current approaches to estimate flood hazards often sample only a relatively small subset of the known unknowns, for example, the uncertainties surrounding the model parameters. This approach neglects the impacts of key uncertainties on hazards and system dynamics. Here we mainstream a recently developed method for Bayesian inference to calibrate a computationally expensive distributed hydrologic model. We compare three different calibration approaches: (a) stepwise line search, (b) precalibration or screening, and (c) the Fast Model Calibrations (FaMoS) approach. FaMoS deploys a particle-based approach that takes advantage of the massive parallelization afforded by modern high-performance computing systems. We quantify how neglecting parametric uncertainty and data discrepancy can drastically underestimate extreme flood events and risks. Precalibration improves prediction skill score over a stepwise line search. The Bayesian calibration improves the uncertainty characterization of model parameters and flood risk projections.}

  abstract = {Current approaches to design flood-sensitive infrastructure typically assume a stationary rainfall distribution and neglect many uncertainties. These assumptions are inconsistent with observations that suggest intensifying extreme precipitation events and the uncertainties surrounding projections of the coupled natural-human systems. Here we demonstrate a safety factor approach to designing urban infrastructure in a changing climate. Our results show that assuming climate stationarity and neglecting deep uncertainties can drastically underestimate flood risks and lead to poor infrastructure design choices. We find that climate uncertainty dominates the socioeconomic and engineering uncertainties that impact the hydraulic reliability in stormwater drainage systems. We quantify the upfront costs needed to achieve higher hydraulic reliability and robustness against the deep uncertainties surrounding projections of rainfall, surface runoff characteristics, and infrastructure lifetime. Depending on the location, we find that adding safety factors of 1.4\textendash 1.7 to the standard stormwater pipe design guidance produces robust performance to the considered deep uncertainties. The insights gained from this study highlights the need for updating traditional engineering design strategies to improve infrastructure reliability under socioeconomic and environmental changes.}

  abstract = {Extratropical cyclones are storm systems that are observed to travel preferentially within confined regions known as storm tracks. They contribute to precipitation, wind and temperature extremes in mid-latitudes. Cyclones tend to form where surface temperature gradients are large, and the jet stream influences their speed and direction of travel. Storm tracks shape the global climate through transport of energy and momentum. The intensity and location of storm tracks varies seasonally, and in response to other natural variations, such as changes in tropical sea surface temperature. A hierarchy of numerical models of the atmosphereocean system from highly idealized to comprehensive has been used to study and predict responses of storm tracks to anthropogenic climate change. The future position and intensity of storm tracks depend on processes that alter temperature gradients. However, different processes can have opposing influences on temperature gradients, which leads to a tug of war on storm track responses and makes future projections more difficult. For example, as climate warms, surface shortwave cloud radiative changes increase the Equator-to-pole temperature gradient, but at the same time, longwave cloud radiative changes reduce this gradient. Future progress depends on understanding and accurately quantifying the relative influence of such processes on the storm tracks.}

  abstract = {The treatment of uncertainty in climate-change science is dominated by the far-reaching influence of the `frequentist' tradition in statistics, which interprets uncertainty in terms of sampling statistics and emphasizes p-values and statistical significance. This is the normative standard in the journals where most climate-change science is published. Yet a sampling distribution is not always meaningful (there is only one planet Earth). Moreover, scientific statements about climate change are hypotheses, and the frequentist tradition has no way of expressing the uncertainty of a hypothesis. As a result, in climate-change science, there is generally a disconnect between physical reasoning and statistical practice. This paper explores how the frequentist statistical methods used in climate-change science can be embedded within the more general framework of probability theory, which is based on very simple logical principles. In this way, the physical reasoning represented in scientific hypotheses, which underpins climate-change science, can be brought into statistical practice in a transparent and logically rigorous way. The principles are illustrated through three examples of controversial scientific topics: the alleged global warming hiatus, Arctic-midlatitude linkages, and extreme event attribution. These examples show how the principles can be applied, in order to develop better scientific practice.}

  abstract = {As climate change research becomes increasingly applied, the need for actionable information is growing rapidly. A key aspect of this requirement is the representation of uncertainties. The conventional approach to representing uncertainty in physical aspects of climate change is probabilistic, based on ensembles of climate model simulations. In the face of deep uncertainties, the known limitations of this approach are becoming increasingly apparent. An alternative is thus emerging which may be called a `storyline' approach. We define a storyline as a physically self-consistent unfolding of past events, or of plausible future events or pathways. No a priori probability of the storyline is assessed; emphasis is placed instead on understanding the driving factors involved, and the plausibility of those factors. We introduce a typology of four reasons for using storylines to represent uncertainty in physical aspects of climate change: (i) improving risk awareness by framing risk in an event-oriented rather than a probabilistic manner, which corresponds more directly to how people perceive and respond to risk; (ii) strengthening decision-making by allowing one to work backward from a particular vulnerability or decision point, combining climate change information with other relevant factors to address compound risk and develop appropriate stress tests; (iii) providing a physical basis for partitioning uncertainty, thereby allowing the use of more credible regional models in a conditioned manner and (iv) exploring the boundaries of plausibility, thereby guarding against false precision and surprise. Storylines also offer a powerful way of linking physical with human aspects of climate change.}

  abstract = {We assess evidence relevant to Earth's equilibrium climate sensitivity per doubling of atmospheric CO2, characterized by an effective sensitivity S. This evidence includes feedback process understanding, the historical climate record, and the paleoclimate record. An S value lower than 2 K is difficult to reconcile with any of the three lines of evidence. The amount of cooling during the Last Glacial Maximum provides strong evidence against values of S greater than 4.5 K. Other lines of evidence in combination also show that this is relatively unlikely. We use a Bayesian approach to produce a probability density (PDF) for S given all the evidence, including tests of robustness to difficult-to-quantify uncertainties and different priors. The 66\% range is 2.6-3.9 K for our Baseline calculation, and remains within 2.3-4.5 K under the robustness tests; corresponding 5-95\% ranges are 2.3-4.7 K, bounded by 2.0-5.7 K (although such high-confidence ranges should be regarded more cautiously). This indicates a stronger constraint on S than reported in past assessments, by lifting the low end of the range. This narrowing occurs because the three lines of evidence agree and are judged to be largely independent, and because of greater confidence in understanding feedback processes and in combining evidence. We identify promising avenues for further narrowing the range in S, in particular using comprehensive models and process understanding to address limitations in the traditional forcing-feedback paradigm for interpreting past changes.},

Instead, cities have doubled down on waterfront development. We ask why and with what implications, using the U.S. state of Massachusetts as a case study. By overlaying data on sea level rise, land use, and property taxes, we find a few coastal cities may lose significant levels of municipal revenues to long-term sea level rise, while others face negligible impacts. Coastal municipalities are cognizant of their risks yet continue to site redevelopment projects in flood-vulnerable areas to meet present-day budgetary needs. Moreover, they resist efforts to align property values and insurance premiums with climate risks, as reforms only hasten lost taxes. Left unchanged, existing land use and fiscal policies incentivize municipalities to make short-term decisions with accelerating climate risks over time. This creates new dynamics of fiscal stress that can increase regional inequality and vulnerability to climate change. The study highlights the need for dialogue among researchers and policymakers in the U.S. and internationally on the nexus between land use planning, government administration, and climate change as these tensions likely exist wherever local governments rely on land-based finance.}

  abstract = {With the goal of making high-resolution forecasts of regional rainfall, precipitation nowcasting has become an important and fundamental technology underlying various public services ranging from rainstorm warnings to flight safety. Recently, the Convolutional LSTM (ConvLSTM) model has been shown to outperform traditional optical flow based methods for precipitation nowcasting, suggesting that deep learning models have a huge potential for solving the problem. However, the convolutional recurrence structure in ConvLSTM-based models is location-invariant while natural motion and transformation (e.g., rotation) are location-variant in general. Furthermore, since deep-learning-based precipitation nowcasting is a newly emerging area, clear evaluation protocols have not yet been established. To address these problems, we propose both a new model and a benchmark for precipitation nowcasting. Specifically, we go beyond ConvLSTM and propose the Trajectory GRU (TrajGRU) model that can actively learn the location-variant structure for recurrent connections. Besides, we provide a benchmark that includes a real-world large-scale dataset from the Hong Kong Observatory, a new training loss, and a comprehensive evaluation protocol to facilitate future research and gauge the state of the art.}

  abstract = {Global climate change poses significant risks to coastal and riverine communities. Managed retreat, the purposeful movement of people and infrastructure out of vulnerable floodplains, is one possible adaptation strategy. The USA has already engaged in a limited amount of retreat by providing federal funds to purchase and demolish or relocate vulnerable properties. As retreat programs are expected to expand in size and frequency to address the increased risks posed by climate change, a review of how such property acquisition programs have been implemented is timely. Specifically, decisions made by government officials regarding where to acquire properties have significant potential social justice implications, as buyouts could promote or reduce existing social inequities, but it is unclear how such decisions are being made. A review of eight US buyout programs suggests that buyouts, as practiced, lack transparency, which may increase public distrust of the process and reduce participation. Moreover, decisions often involve political motivations and rely on cost-benefit logic that may promote disproportionate retreat in low-income or minority communities, continuing historic patterns of social inequity. However, as low-income communities in the USA also tend to be highly vulnerable to climate-exacerbated hazards, a decision not to relocate may also promote disproportionate harm. The buyout programs reviewed provide examples of how to mitigate these concerns through increased transparency, emphasis on relocation, explicit focus on social inequality, longer-term and larger-scale holistic approaches, and participatory pre-disaster planning. Further research on past programs is needed to evaluate outcomes and processes to improve future adaptation efforts.}

  abstract = {The climate science community is challenged to adopt an actionable risk perspective, which is difficult to align with the traditional focus on model-based probabilistic climate change projections. Event-based storylines can provide a way out of this conundrum by putting emphasis on plausibility rather than probability. This links directly to common practices in disaster risk management using ``stress-testing'' for emergency preparedness based on events that are conditional on specific and plausible assumptions. Event-based storylines allow for conditional explanations, without full attribution of every causal factor, which is crucial when some aspects of the latter are complex and highly uncertain.}

We investigate how to effectively group samples for testing based on a transmission network. We formalize the group assembling problem as a graph partitioning problem, where the goal is to minimize the expected number of tests needed to screen the entire network. The problem is shown to be computationally hard and thus we focus on designing effective heuristics for it. Using realistic epidemic models on real contact networks, we show that our approaches save up to 33\textbackslash\% of resources---compared to the best baseline---at 4\textbackslash\% prevalence, are still effective at higher prevalence, and are robust to missing transmission data.},

  abstract = {The differences on the phase and wavelength of the quasi-stationary waves over the South America generated by El Ni\~no (EN) and La Ni\~na (LN) events seem to affect the daily evolution of the South American Low Level Jet east of the Andes (SALLJ). For the austral summer period of 19772004 the SALLJ episodes detected according to Bonner criterion 1 show normal to above-normal frequency in EN years, and in LN years the episodes show normal to below-normal frequency. During EN and LN years the SALLJ episodes were associated with positive rainfall anomalies over the La Plata Basin, but more intense during LN years. During EN years the increase in the SALLJ cases were associated to intensification of the Subtropical Jet (SJ) around 30\textsuperscript{ }S and positive Sea Level Pressure (SLP) anomalies over the western equatorial Atlantic and tropical South America, particularly over central Brazil. This favored the intensification of the northeasterly trade winds over the northern continent and it channeled by the Andes mountain to the La Plata Basin region where negative SLP are found. The SALLJ cases identified during the LN events were weaker and less frequent when compared to those for EN years. In this case the SJ was weaker than in EN years and the negative SLP anomalies over the tropical continent contributed to the inversion of the northeasterly trade winds. Also a southerly flow anomaly was generated by the geostrophic balance due to the anomalous blocking over southeast Pacific and the intense cyclonic transient over the southern tip of South America. As result the warm tropical air brought by the SALLJ encounters the cold extratropical air from the southerly winds over the La Plata basin. This configuration can increase the conditional instability over the La Plata basin and may explain the more intense positive rainfall anomalies in SALLJ cases during LN years than in EN years.}

Recently, AlphaGo became the first program to defeat a world champion in the game of Go. The tree search in AlphaGo evaluated positions and selected moves using deep neural networks. These neural networks were trained by supervised learning from human expert moves, and by reinforcement learning from self-play. Here we introduce an algorithm based solely on reinforcement learning, without human data, guidance or domain knowledge beyond game rules. AlphaGo becomes its own teacher: a neural network is trained to predict AlphaGo's own move selections and also the winner of AlphaGo's games. This neural network improves the strength of the tree search, resulting in higher quality move selection and stronger self-play in the next iteration. Starting tabula rasa, our new program AlphaGo Zero achieved superhuman performance, winning 100\textendash 0 against the previously published, champion-defeating AlphaGo.}

  abstract = {One program to rule them all Computers can beat humans at increasingly complex games, including chess and Go. However, these programs are typically constructed for a particular game, exploiting its properties, such as the symmetries of the board on which it is played. Silver et al. developed a program called AlphaZero, which taught itself to play Go, chess, and shogi (a Japanese version of chess) (see the Editorial, and the Perspective by Campbell). AlphaZero managed to beat state-of-the-art programs specializing in these three games. The ability of AlphaZero to adapt to various game rules is a notable step toward achieving a general game-playing system. Science, this issue p. 1140; see also pp. 1087 and 1118 The game of chess is the longest-studied domain in the history of artificial intelligence. The strongest programs are based on a combination of sophisticated search techniques, domain-specific adaptations, and handcrafted evaluation functions that have been refined by human experts over several decades. By contrast, the AlphaGo Zero program recently achieved superhuman performance in the game of Go by reinforcement learning from self-play. In this paper, we generalize this approach into a single AlphaZero algorithm that can achieve superhuman performance in many challenging games. Starting from random play and given no domain knowledge except the game rules, AlphaZero convincingly defeated a world champion program in the games of chess and shogi (Japanese chess), as well as Go. AlphaZero teaches itself to play three different board games and beats state-of-the-art programs in each.

The AAO influence is particularly strong during winter and late spring although of opposite sign. In particular during spring, AAO positive (negative) phases are associated with the intensification of an upper-level anticyclonic (cyclonic) anomaly, weakened (enhanced) moisture convergence and decreased (increased) precipitation over SESA. The combined influence of both ENSO and AAO on SESA precipitation was also explored and significant correlation values between both oscillations are only observed during spring. Results show that during that particular season, AAO activity produces a strong modulation of the ENSO signal on SESA precipitation.}

The dataset and our following analysis reviews treatment train design, estimated electricity consumption, facility capital and operation and maintenance costs, and air emission externalities of those systems. Despite a wide variety of feedwater qualities and augmentation strategies, we observe remarkable consistency in potable reuse treatment train design. We estimate potable reuse electricity intensity for each facility as a function of feedwater quality and installed unit processes, finding that advanced treatment train electricity intensities fall within the range of 0.23\textendash 2.5 kWh m-3. This range excludes the energy required for conveying water to advanced treatment facilities or pumping the water for supply augmentation. For 25 facilities with capital cost data, we find that potable reuse capital costs normalized by system design capacity fall between 1000 and 5300 \$ per m3 d. Subsequent cost analysis of the subset of full advanced treatment (FAT) systems suggests capacity normalized capital costs between 1800 and 4100 \$ per m3 d and capacity normalized operation and maintenance costs between 100 and 200 \$ per m3 d. These ranges validate previously reported bottom-up cost estimates for FAT facilities. Finally, we use the Water AHEAD model to estimate the annual human health, environmental, and climate damages for representative advanced treatment trains. Air emission externalities from U.S. potable reuse facilities fall between 10 and 40 \$ per thousand m3, with the majority of damages associated with electricity consumption at potable reuse facilities.}

However, existing studies on the pattern of floods and their impact on agriculture in Bangladesh are limited. Here we examined the spatiotemporal pattern of floods for the country during 2014\textendash 2018 using all the available Sentinel-1 Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) images and the Google Earth Engine (GEE) platform. We also identified the flood-affected paddy rice fields by integrating the flooding areas and remote sensing-based paddy rice planting areas. Our results indicate that flooding is frequent in northeastern Bangladesh and along the three major rivers, the Ganges, Brahmaputra, and Meghna. Between 2014 and 2018, the flood-affected paddy rice areas accounted for 1.61\textendash 18.17\% of the total paddy rice area. The satellite-based detection of floods and flood-affected paddy rice fields advance our understanding of the annual dynamics of flooding in Bangladesh, which is essential for adaptation and mitigation strategies where severe annual floods threaten human lives, properties, and agricultural production.}

Methodologically, surveys were sent to a random sample of 2,500 coastal North Carolina homeowners who provided insights about their hurricane and mitigation experiences. The sample was purchased from Genesys, which utilises the postal service's database to randomly select addresses. Binary logistic regression was used to compute homeowners' intention to adopt eight separate mitigation actions for their homes. The findings show limited support on the influence of emotion and risk perception on intention to mitigate. However, the findings clearly support the relationships between intention to mitigate and the influence of others and perceptions of the characteristics of the mitigation actions. The significance of the findings indicates the importance of utilising these factors in future studies to better understand mitigation decision-making and to inform future mitigation policies and programs.}

This study measured the complementarity of wind and solar resources sited in various regions of Texas. This study modeled solar and wind power output using the System Advisory Model with solar data from the National Solar Radiation Database and wind data from the Wind Integration National Dataset Toolkit. Half-hourly power production was assessed based on resource location, plant size, hourly load, inter-annual variability, and solar array design for all sites. We found that solar and wind resources exhibit complementary peaks in production on an annual and daily level and that West and South Texas wind resources also exhibit complementarity. Pairings of West Texas wind with solar power or South Texas wind sites yield the highest firm capacity. Solar farms are better suited for providing power during summertime hours of peak demand, whereas wind farms are better for winter. Taken together, our results suggest that Texas renewable power production can be made more reliable by combining resources of different types and locations.}

The massive power outage in the face of Winter Storm Uri has been written about and critiqued both nationally and internationally.

Pundits have had a field day chasing their pet theories, and politicians have held numerous hearings and made strong declarations as to how this will never happen again, and even possibly undo the pricing of power during the crisis. Politicians have also been pointing fingers of blame, often misplaced.

A systematic CAO index and ranking system was developed from 20 surface weather stations from 1948 through 2016, based on a set of criteria concerning magnitude, duration, and spatial extent. Standard deviations in temperature were used to identify extreme temperatures relative to the station. A total of 49 CAOs occurred during the 67-year period, with the majority occurring during mid-winter. The number of CAOs proved to be largely dependent on the stations latitude and maritime influence. The duration, magnitude, and spatial extent were dependent on the time of the winter season in which the CAO occurred. Furthermore, two prominent clusters of an increased number of CAOs occurred during the 67-year period, suggesting multi-decadal circulations may be a factor in CAOs.}

  abstract = {Quantifying signals and uncertainties in climate models is essential for the detection, attribution, prediction and projection of climate change1\textendash 3. Although inter-model agreement is high for large-scale temperature signals, dynamical changes in atmospheric circulation are very uncertain4. This leads to low confidence in regional projections, especially for precipitation, over the coming decades5,6. The chaotic nature of the climate system7\textendash 9 may also mean that signal uncertainties are largely irreducible. However, climate projections are difficult to verify until further observations become available. Here we assess retrospective climate model predictions of the past six decades and show that decadal variations in North Atlantic winter climate are highly predictable, despite a lack of agreement between individual model simulations and the poor predictive ability of raw model outputs. Crucially, current models underestimate the predictable signal (the predictable fraction of the total variability) of the North Atlantic Oscillation (the leading mode of variability in North Atlantic atmospheric circulation) by an order of magnitude. Consequently, compared to perfect models, 100 times as many ensemble members are needed in current models to extract this signal, and its effects on the climate are underestimated relative to other factors. To address these limitations, we implement a two-stage post-processing technique. We first adjust the variance of the ensemble-mean North Atlantic Oscillation forecast to match the observed variance of the predictable signal. We then select and use only the ensemble members with a North Atlantic Oscillation sufficiently close to the variance-adjusted ensemble-mean forecast North Atlantic Oscillation. This approach greatly improves decadal predictions of winter climate for Europe and eastern North America. Predictions of Atlantic multidecadal variability are also improved, suggesting that the North Atlantic Oscillation is not driven solely by Atlantic multidecadal variability. Our results highlight the need to understand why the signal-to-noise ratio is too small in current climate models10, and the extent to which correcting this model error would reduce uncertainties in regional climate change projections on timescales beyond a decade.},

  abstract = {We examine the upper tail of flood peak distributions through analyses of annual peak observations from more than 8,000 U.S. Geological Survey (USGS) stream gaging stations and through hydrometeorological analyses of the storms that produce the most extreme floods. We focus on the distribution of the upper tail ratio, which is defined as the peak discharge for the flood of record at a stream gaging station divided by the sample 10-year flood magnitude. The 14 June 1903 Heppner storm, which produced an upper tail ratio of 200, was the product of a hailstorm that formed along the Blue Mountains in eastern Oregon, a region dominated by snowmelt flooding. A striking contrast between record flood peaks and the larger distribution of annual flood peaks in the United States is in the seasonality of flood occurrence, with record floods reflecting a much stronger contribution from warm season thunderstorm systems. Mountainous terrain and intense convective rainfall are important elements of the geography and hydrometeorology of extreme upper tail ratio flood peaks. The distribution of upper tail ratio values for USGS stream gaging stations does not depend on basin area, a result which is consistent with scaling results based on extreme value theory. Downscaling simulations with the Weather Research and Forecasting model are used to examine the storm environment of the 1903 Heppner storm, along with two other record flood peaks near the Blue Mountains of eastern Oregon from the USGS miscellaneous flood record, the July 1956 Meyers Canyon flood and the July 1965 Lane Canyon flood.},

  abstract = {Hurricane wind risk assessment has been significantly improved with the evolvement of synthesis methodologies from the single site probabilistic method to the hurricane track model (including five simulation components of genesis, translation, intensity, decay and boundary-layer wind). As first-step efforts towards advancing the data-driven hurricane track model, widely used by engineering community, to a physics-based framework for more accurate and reliable hurricane risk assessment, a new intensity model integrating important dynamics and thermodynamics inside the storms is developed. Furthermore, an extensive statistical analysis of hurricane trajectories is carried out to obtain an enhanced translation model and a height-resolving analytical wind model is utilized to acquire the vertical profiles of wind speed and direction between ground-surface and gradient levels. The other two simulation components (i.e., genesis and decay) of the hurricane track model are also revisited for the sake of completeness. Ten thousand years of full-track synthetic hurricanes are generated and compared with the HURDAT database at specific mileposts along the US East coast to validate the overall performance of the developed simulation framework (in terms of annual occurrence rate, intensity, translation speed and heading angle). Then, the New Jersey coastline is employed as a case study to compare the simulated hurricane wind speeds with ASCE 7\textendash 16 recommendations, to highlight the wind directionality effects on extreme wind speeds, and to investigate the joint distribution of hurricane wind speed and size.}

  abstract = {Seasonal climate forecasts (SCF) can support decision-making and thus help society cope with and prepare for climate variability and change. The demand for understanding the value and benefits of using SCF in decision-making processes can be associated with different logics. Two of these would be the need to justify public and private investment in the provision of SCF and demonstrating the gains and benefits of using SCF in specific decision-making contexts. This paper reviews the main factors influencing how SCF is (or can be) valued in supporting decision-making and the main methods and metrics currently used to perform such valuations. Our review results in four key findings: (a) there is a current emphasis on economic ex ante studies and the quantification of SCF value; (b) there are fundamental differences in how the value of SCF is defined and estimated across methods and approaches; (c) most valuation methods are unable to capture the differential benefits and risks of using SCF across spatiotemporal scales and groups; and (d) there is limited involvement of the decision-makers in the valuation process. The paper concludes by providing some guiding principles towards more effective valuations of SCF, notably the need for a wider diversity and integration of methodological approaches. These should particularly embrace ex-post, qualitative, and participatory approaches which allow co-evaluation with decision-makers so that more comprehensive and equitable SCF valuations can be developed in future.

  abstract = {Most current climate models predict that the equatorial Pacific will evolve under greenhouse gas\textendash induced warming to a more El Ni\~no-like state over the next several decades, with a reduced zonal sea surface temperature gradient and weakened atmospheric Walker circulation. Yet, observations over the last 50 y show the opposite trend, toward a more La Ni\~na-like state. Recent research provides evidence that the discrepancy cannot be dismissed as due to internal variability but rather that the models are incorrectly simulating the equatorial Pacific response to greenhouse gas warming. This implies that projections of regional tropical cyclone activity may be incorrect as well, perhaps even in the direction of change, in ways that can be understood by analogy to historical El Ni\~no and La Ni\~na events: North Pacific tropical cyclone projections will be too active, North Atlantic ones not active enough, for example. Other perils, including severe convective storms and droughts, will also be projected erroneously. While it can be argued that these errors are transient, such that the models' responses to greenhouse gases may be correct in equilibrium, the transient response is relevant for climate adaptation in the next several decades. Given the urgency of understanding regional patterns of climate risk in the near term, it would be desirable to develop projections that represent a broader range of possible future tropical Pacific warming scenarios\textemdash including some in which recent historical trends continue\textemdash even if such projections cannot currently be produced using existing coupled earth system models.}

Yet this frequency is poorly understood. There is no accepted theory that explains the average number of TCs that occur each year on the Earth, nor how that number will change with global warming. Arguments based on global budgets of heat or moisture do not yet appear helpful, nor does a detailed understanding of the physical processes of TC genesis. Empirical indices that predict TC frequency as a function of large-scale environmental variables can explain some of its relative variations in space and time, but not its absolute value. Global numerical models with horizontal grid spacings on the order of 25\textendash 50 km have allowed much improved simulations of TC activity, however. Many such models project a decrease in frequency with warming, but some project an increase. Idealized simulations, including those at higher resolutions, offer promise by allowing a systematic, deductive investigation of the roles of individual environmental factors. In addition to the larger-scale environmental modulation of genesis likelihood, precursor disturbances, or ``seeds'', may exert an independent influence on TC frequency.},

This article complements some of the previous review articles in that it compares various simulation algorithms, assesses their relative computational efficiency and versatility, discusses the properties of generated field samples, and incorporates some of the recent developments. Collectively, a comprehensive discussion of the covariance decomposition method, the spectral method, the ARMA method, the noise shower method, the scale refinement methods, and the turning band method is attempted. For tutorial effectiveness univariate, uni-dimensional, Gaussian, and homogeneous fields are discussed, primarily in connection with various simulation methods. Nevertheless, appropriate references are included addressing the simulation of more general fields. This review article contains 110 references.}

  abstract = {Hydroclimatic stationarity is increasingly questioned as a default assumption in flood risk management (FRM), but successor methods are not yet established. Some potential successors depend on estimates of future flood quantiles, but methods for estimating future design storms are subject to high levels of uncertainty. Here we apply a Nonstationary Decision Model (NDM) to flood risk planning within the decision scaling framework. The NDM combines a nonstationary probability distribution of annual peak flow with optimal selection of flood management alternatives using robustness measures. The NDM incorporates structural and nonstructural FRM interventions and valuation of flows supporting ecosystem services to calculate expected cost of a given FRM strategy. A search for the minimum-cost strategy under incrementally varied representative scenarios extending across the plausible range of flood trend and value of the natural flow regime discovers candidate FRM strategies that are evaluated and compared through a decision scaling analysis (DSA). The DSA selects a management strategy that is optimal or close to optimal across the broadest range of scenarios or across the set of scenarios deemed most likely to occur according to estimates of future flood hazard. We illustrate the decision framework using a stylized example flood management decision based on the Iowa City flood management system, which has experienced recent unprecedented high flow episodes. The DSA indicates a preference for combining infrastructural and nonstructural adaptation measures to manage flood risk and makes clear that options-based approaches cannot be assumed to be ``no'' or ``low regret.''}

The importance of the identification of L-A interaction regions lies in the potential improvement of the weather/seasonal forecast and the better understanding of the physical mechanisms involved. This study aims to compare the terrestrial segment of the L-A interaction from satellite products and climate models, motivated by previous modeling studies pointing out southeastern South America (SESA) as a L-A hotspot during austral summer. In addition, the L-A interaction under dry or wet anomalous conditions over SESA is analyzed. To identify L-A hotspots the AMSRE-LPRM SM and MODIS land surface temperature products; coupled climate models and uncoupled land surface models were used. SESA highlights as a strong L-A interaction hotspot when employing different metrics, temporal scales and independent datasets, showing consistency between models and satellite estimations. Both AMSRE-LPRM bands (X and C) are consistent showing a strong L-A interaction hotspot over the Pampas ecoregion. Intensification and a larger spatial extent of the L-A interaction for dry summers was observed in both satellite products and models compared to wet summers. These results, which were derived from measured physical variables, are encouraging and promising for future studies analyzing L-A interactions. L-A interaction analysis is proposed here as a meeting point between remote sensing and climate modelling communities of Argentina, within a region with the highest agricultural and livestock production of the continent, but with an important lack of in-situ SM observations.}

However, ABMs are often not calibrated in a statistical sense. Here we examine the impact of data record structure on the calibration of an ABM for housing abandonment in the presence of flood risk. Using a perfect model experiment, we examine the impact of data record structures on (i) model calibration and (ii) the ability to distinguish a model with inter-agent interactions from one without. We show how limited data sets may not constrain a model with just four parameters. This indicates that many ABMs may require informative prior distributions to be descriptive. We also illustrate how spatially-aggregated data can be insufficient to identify the correct model structure. This emphasizes the need for utilizing independent lines of evidence to select sound and informative priors.},

  abstract = {Probabilistic projections of baseline (with no additional mitigation policies) future carbon emissions are important for sound climate risk assessments. Deep uncertainty surrounds many drivers of projected emissions. Here, we use a simple integrated assessment model, calibrated to century-scale data and expert assessments of baseline emissions, global economic growth, and population growth, to make probabilistic projections of carbon emissions through 2100. Under a variety of assumptions about fossil fuel resource levels and decarbonization rates, our projections largely agree with several emissions projections under current policy conditions. Our global sensitivity analysis identifies several key economic drivers of uncertainty in future emissions and shows important higher-level interactions between economic and technological parameters, while population uncertainties are less important. Our analysis also projects relatively low global economic growth rates over the remainder of the century. This illustrates the importance of additional research into economic growth dynamics for climate risk assessment, especially if pledged and future climate mitigation policies are weakened or have delayed implementations. These results showcase the power of using a simple, transparent, and calibrated model. While the simple model structure has several advantages, it also creates caveats for our results which are related to important areas for further research.}

However, multi-sector systems are also subject to numerous uncertainties that prevent the direct application of simulation models for prediction and planning, particularly when extrapolating past behavior to a nonstationary future. Recent studies have developed a combination of methods to characterize, attribute, and quantify these uncertainties for both single- and multi-sector systems. Here, we review challenges and complications to the idealized goal of fully quantifying all uncertainties in a multi-sector model and their interactions with policy design as they emerge at different stages of analysis: (a) inference and model calibration; (b) projecting future outcomes; and (c) scenario discovery and identification of risk regimes. We also identify potential methods and research opportunities to help navigate the tradeoffs inherent in uncertainty analyses for complex systems. During this discussion, we provide a classification of uncertainty types and discuss model coupling frameworks to support interdisciplinary collaboration on multi-sector dynamics (MSD) research. Finally, we conclude with recommendations for best practices to ensure that MSD research can be properly contextualized with respect to the underlying uncertainties.}

Early attempts to quantify water security relied on static index based approaches that failed to acknowledge that human action is intrinsic to the water cycle. Human adaptation to environmental change and increasing spatial specialization in the modern world necessitate a more flexible and dynamic view of water security. Starting from first principles, and through application of simple water balance concepts to human-impacted water systems, we first develop a set of indicators for water insecurity. We then offer an approach to model these indicators as outcomes of coupled human-water systems to anticipate watershed trajectories under human impacts, predict water insecurity and inform appropriate action. In this way, far from being a static index, water security signifies a ``safe operating subspace'' within a three dimensional space that maps physical resource availability, infrastructure and economic choices.}

  abstract = {There is a scientific consensus regarding the reality of anthropogenic climate change. This has led to substantial efforts to reduce atmospheric greenhouse gas emissions and thereby mitigate the impacts of climate change on a global scale. Despite these efforts, we are committed to substantial further changes over at least the next few decades. Societies will therefore have to adapt to changes in climate. Both adaptation and mitigation require action on scales ranging from local to global, but adaptation could directly benefit from climate predictions on regional scales while mitigation could be driven solely by awareness of the global problem; regional projections being principally of motivational value. We discuss how recent developments of large ensembles of climate model simulations can be interpreted to provide information on these scales and to inform societal decisions. Adaptation is most relevant as an influence on decisions which exist irrespective of climate change, but which have consequences on decadal time-scales. Even in such situations, climate change is often only a minor influence; perhaps helping to restrict the choice of `no regrets' strategies. Nevertheless, if climate models are to provide inputs to societal decisions, it is important to interpret them appropriately. We take climate ensembles exploring model uncertainty as potentially providing a lower bound on the maximum range of uncertainty and thus a non-discountable climate change envelope. An analysis pathway is presented, describing how this information may provide an input to decisions, sometimes via a number of other analysis procedures and thus a cascade of uncertainty. An initial screening is seen as a valuable component of this process, potentially avoiding unnecessary effort while guiding decision makers through issues of confidence and robustness in climate modelling information. Our focus is the usage of decadal to centennial time-scale climate change simulations as inputs to decision making, but we acknowledge that robust adaptation to the variability of present day climate encourages the development of less vulnerable systems as well as building critical experience in how to respond to climatic uncertainty.}

Both have solid theoretical motivation, but address different concerns. The description of hydrologic risk and uncertainty provided by new risk and uncertainty procedures adopted by the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers, and risk-based design procedures developed by others, are shown to be equivalent to the expected probability model in simple cases. A 1995 National Research Council (NRC) report recommended against use of the expected probability model for evaluating expected annual damages and the probability of flooding; in particular, the NRC analysis and the 1989 Arnell analysis demonstrated that expected probability estimators yield risk and damage estimators that generally have large positive biases. Historical arguments and related issues are reviewed. Resolution of this controversy and success of the new U.S. Army Corps of Engineers (USACE) risk and uncertainty procedures require a clear framework for understanding what is meant by risk, variability, and uncertainty. Such risk analyses can better represent a community's vulnerability to flooding and the large uncertainty in estimates of expected damages and residual flood risk.},

These results illustrate the difficulty in making the PP consistent with the acceptance of any tradeoffs between catastrophic risks and more ordinary goods. How one interprets these results will, however, depend on one's views and commitments. For instance, those who are convinced that the conditions in the impossibility results are requirements of rationality may see these results as undermining the rationality of the PP.

This work also provides the first paleoclimatic support for the prediction that the risk of American Southwest megadroughts will markedly increase with global warming.

  abstract = {Vulnerability-based frameworks are increasingly used to better understand water system performance under climate change. This work advances the use of stochastic weather generators for climate vulnerability assessments that simulate weather based on patterns of regional atmospheric flow (i.e., weather regimes) conditioned on global-scale climate features. The model is semiparametric by design and includes (1) a nonhomogeneous Markov chain for weather regime simulation; (2) block bootstrapping and a Gaussian copula for multivariate, multisite weather simulation; and (3) modules to impose thermodynamic and dynamical climate change, including Clausius-Clapeyron precipitation scaling, elevation-dependent warming, and shifting dynamics of the El Ni\~no\textendash Southern Oscillation (ENSO). In this way, the model can be used to evaluate climate impacts on water systems based on hypotheses of dynamic and thermodynamic climate change. The model is developed and tested for cold-season climate in the Tuolumne River Basin in California but is broadly applicable across the western United States. Results show that eight weather regimes exert strong influences over local climate in the Tuolumne Basin. Model simulations adequately preserve many of the historical statistics for precipitation and temperature across sites, including the mean, variance, skew, and extreme values. Annual precipitation and temperature are somewhat underdispersed, and precipitation spell statistics are negatively biased by 1-2 days. For simulations of future climate, the model can generate a range of Clausius-Clapeyron scaling relationships and modes of elevation-dependent warming. Model simulations also suggest a muted response of Tuolumne climate to changes in ENSO variability.}

  abstract = {A multivariate, multisite daily weather generator is presented for use in decision-centric vulnerability assessments under climate change. The tool is envisioned to be useful for a wide range of socioeconomic and biophysical systems sensitive to different aspects of climate variability and change. The proposed stochastic model has several components, including (1) a wavelet decomposition coupled to an autoregressive model to account for structured, low-frequency climate oscillations, (2) a Markov chain and k-nearest-neighbor (KNN) resampling scheme to simulate spatially distributed, multivariate weather variables over a region, and (3) a quantile mapping procedure to enforce long-term distributional shifts in weather variables that result from prescribed climate changes. The Markov chain is used to better represent wet and dry spell statistics, while the KNN bootstrap resampler preserves the covariance structure between the weather variables and across space. The wavelet-based autoregressive model is applied to annual climate over the region and used to modulate the Markov chain and KNN resampling, embedding appropriate low-frequency structure within the daily weather generation process. Parameters can be altered in any of the components of the proposed model to enable the generation of realistic time series of climate variables that exhibit changes to both lower-order and higher-order statistics at long-term (interannual), mid-term (seasonal), and short-term (daily) timescales. The tool can be coupled with impact models in a bottom-up risk assessment to efficiently and exhaustively explore the potential climate changes under which a system is most vulnerable. An application of the weather generator is presented for the Connecticut River basin to demonstrate the tool's ability to generate a wide range of possible climate sequences over an extensive spatial domain.}

  abstract = {The implications of climate change and the potential nonstationarity of the hydrologic record necessitate innovative approaches to water management. This study presents a novel adaptation strategy for water reservoir management under nonstationary hydrologic conditions. Seasonal hydrologic forecasts and a real-option instrument allow reservoir operations that dynamically adapt to an evolving hydrologic record. System operating policies are conditioned on seasonal hydrologic forecasts to account for year-to-year variability and climate change and a real option is established to hedge against the risk associated with operational forecasts and unexpected climate outcomes. This scheme is implemented over an ensemble of climate futures based on general circulation model (GCM) simulations. Two alternative management strategies are considered, one in which system operations are optimized for the GCM-based ensemble mean projection of the future and a baseline strategy in which assumptions of stationarity are maintained and operations are left unchanged from historic norms. The approach is evaluated for a water supply\textendash hydropower facility on the Westfield River in the northeast United States. Results suggest that seasonal hydrologic forecasts are a promising adaptation to nonstationary hydrology, even without the support of a risk hedging option. Surprisingly, the option approach enabled even a stationary assumption to perform well in the future, suggesting that option instruments alone can act as a robust adaptation mechanism.},

The empirical orthogonal functions (EOFs) of seasonal TME-based precipitation are analyzed separately for each season to identify the dominant modes of inter-annual variability. Loading patterns for the first EOF show a distinct seasonal cycle in the core region of TME-based precipitation across the eastern U.S., while the second EOF describes a northwest-southeast oscillation in the center of TME-induced precipitation occurrence. The EOFs for TMEs are compared against EOFs of gaged flood count data, which exhibit similar spatial structures. Correlations between TME EOFs, geopotential ...}

The character of liquid precipitation (defined as a combination of accumulation, frequency, and intensity) over the global oceans is significantly different from the character of liquid precipitation produced by global weather and climate models. Five different models are used in this comparison representing state-of-the-art weather prediction models, state-of-the-art climate models, and the emerging high-resolution global cloud ``resolving'' models. The differences between observed and modeled precipitation are larger than can be explained by observational retrieval errors or by the inherent sampling differences between observations and models. We show that the time integrated accumulations of precipitation produced by models closely match observations when globally composited. However, these models produce precipitation approximately twice as often as that observed and make rainfall far too lightly. This finding reinforces similar findings from other studies based on surface accumulated rainfall measurements. The implications of this dreary state of model depiction of the real world are discussed.}

Here, we combine simulated heat exposure data during historical heat wave events in three large U.S. cities to assess the degree to which heat-related mortality and morbidity change in response to a concurrent electrical grid failure event. We develop a novel approach to estimating individually experienced temperature to approximate how personal-level heat exposure changes on an hourly basis, accounting for both outdoor and building-interior exposures. We find the concurrence of a multiday blackout event with heat wave conditions to more than double the estimated rate of heat-related mortality across all three cities, and to require medical attention for between 3\% (Atlanta) and more than 50\% (Phoenix) of the total urban population in present and future time periods. Our results highlight the need for enhanced electrical grid resilience and support a more spatially expansive use of tree canopy and high albedo roofing materials to lessen heat exposures during compound climate and infrastructure failure events.}

We apply the method to a sequence of SeaWiFS satellite images in Lake Michigan from March 1998, when a large sediment plume was observed in the images following a major storm event. Using our approach, we combine the images with a sediment transport model to produce maps of sediment concentrations and uncertainties over space and time.

However, previous research falls short in addressing the risks that joint uncertainties in these processes pose in power systems and wholesale electricity markets. Limiting challenges have included the large areal extents of power systems, high temporal resolutions (hourly or sub-hourly), and the data volumes and computational intensities required. This paper introduces an open source modeling framework for evaluating risks from correlated hydrometeorological processes in electricity markets at decision relevant scales. The framework is able to reproduce historical price dynamics in high profile systems, while also offering unique capabilities for stochastic simulation. Synthetic generation of weather and hydrologic variables is coupled with simulation models of relevant infrastructure (dams, power plants). Our model will allow the role of hydrometeorological uncertainty (including compound extreme events) on electricity market outcomes to be explored using publicly available models.}

  abstract = {Hydrometeorological conditions influence the operations of bulk electric power systems and wholesale markets for electricity. Streamflow is the ``fuel'' for hydropower generation, wind speeds and solar irradiance dictate the availability of wind and solar power production, and air temperatures strongly affect heating and cooling demands. Despite growing concern about the vulnerability of power systems to hydrometeorological uncertainty, including ``compound'' extremes (multiple extremes occurring simultaneously), quantifying baseline probabilistic risks remains difficult even without factoring in climate change. Here, we use newly developed power system simulation software to show how uncertainties in spatially and temporally correlated hydrometeorological processes affect market prices and greenhouse gas emissions in California's wholesale electricity market. Results highlight the need for large synthetic datasets to access rare, yet plausible system states that have not occurred in the recent historical record. We find that time scale strongly controls which combinations of hydrometeorological variables cause extreme outcomes. Although scarcity caused by low streamflows and high air temperatures has long been considered a primary concern in Western power markets, market prices are more profoundly impacted by weather and streamflow conditions that lead to an overabundance of energy on the grid.}

Our ability to quantify and manage the river states in a timely manner is critical for protecting the public safety and natural resources. In recent years, vector-based river network models have enabled modeling of large river basins at increasingly fine resolutions, but are computationally demanding. This work presents a multistage, physics-guided, graph neural network (GNN) approach for basin-scale river network learning and streamflow forecasting. During training, we train a GNN model to approximate outputs of a high-resolution vector-based river network model; we then fine-tune the pretrained GNN model with streamflow observations. We further apply a graph-based, data-fusion step to correct prediction biases. The GNN-based framework is first demonstrated over a snow-dominated watershed in the western United States. A series of experiments are performed to test different training and imputation strategies. Results show that the trained GNN model can effectively serve as a surrogate of the process-based model with high accuracy, with median Kling\textendash Gupta efficiency (KGE) greater than 0.97. Application of the graph-based data fusion further reduces mismatch between the GNN model and observations, with as much as 50 \% KGE improvement over some cross-validation gages. To improve scalability, a graph-coarsening procedure is introduced and is demonstrated over a much larger basin. Results show that graph coarsening achieves comparable prediction skills at only a fraction of training cost, thus providing important insights into the degree of physical realism needed for developing large-scale GNN-based river network models.{$<$}/p{$>$}}

In this paper we explore an alternative approach in which the policy is explicitly represented by its own function approximator, independent of the value function, and is updated according to the gradient of expected reward with respect to the policy parameters. Williams's REINFORCE method and actor-critic methods are examples of this approach. Our main new result is to show that the gradient can be written in a form suitable for estimation from experience aided by an approximate action-value or advantage function. Using this result, we prove for the first time that a version of policy iteration with arbitrary differentiable function approximation is convergent to a locally optimal policy.}

  abstract = {Nassim Nicholas Taleb, the bestselling author of The Black Swan and one of the foremost thinkers of our time, reveals how to thrive in an uncertain world.  Just as human bones get stronger when subjected to stress and tension, and rumors or riots intensify when someone tries to repress them, many things in life benefit from stress, disorder, volatility, and turmoil. What Taleb has identified and calls ``antifragile'' is that category of things that not only gain from chaos but need it in order to survive and flourish.   In The Black Swan, Taleb showed us that highly improbable and unpredictable events underlie almost everything about our world. In Antifragile, Taleb stands uncertainty on its head, making it desirable, even necessary, and proposes that things be built in an antifragile manner. The antifragile is beyond the resilient or robust. The resilient resists shocks and stays the same; the antifragile gets better and better.   Furthermore, the antifragile is immune to prediction errors and protected from adverse events. Why is the city-state better than the nation-state, why is debt bad for you, and why is what we call ``efficient'' not efficient at all? Why do government responses and social policies protect the strong and hurt the weak? Why should you write your resignation letter before even starting on the job? How did the sinking of the Titanic save lives? The book spans innovation by trial and error, life decisions, politics, urban planning, war, personal finance, economic systems, and medicine. And throughout, in addition to the street wisdom of Fat Tony of Brooklyn, the voices and recipes of ancient wisdom, from Roman, Greek, Semitic, and medieval sources, are loud and clear.  Antifragile is a blueprint for living in a Black Swan world.  Erudite, witty, and iconoclastic, Taleb's message is revolutionary: The antifragile, and only the antifragile, will make it.Praise for Antifragile  ``Taleb takes on everything from the mistakes of modern architecture to the dangers of meddlesome doctors and how overrated formal education is. . . . An ambitious and thought-provoking read . . . highly entertaining.''\textemdash The Economist``This is a bold, entertaining, clever book, richly crammed with insights, stories, fine phrases and intriguing asides. . . . I will have to read it again. And again.''\textemdash The Wall Street Journal``[Taleb] writes as if he were the illegitimate spawn of David Hume and Rev. Bayes, with some DNA mixed in from Norbert Weiner and Laurence Sterne. . . . Taleb is writing original stuff\textemdash not only within the management space but for readers of any literature\textemdash and . . . you will learn more about more things from this book and be challenged in more ways than by any other book you have read this year. Trust me on this.''\textemdash Harvard Business Review``By far my favorite book among several good ones published in 2012. In addition to being an enjoyable and interesting read, Taleb's new book advances general understanding of how different systems operate, the great variation in how they respond to unthinkables, and how to make them more adaptable and agile. His systemic insights extend very well to company-specific operational issues\textemdash from ensuring that mistakes provide a learning process to the importance of ensuring sufficient transparency to the myriad of specific risk issues.''\textemdash Mohamed El-Erian, CEO of PIMCO, Bloomberg},

Switching from thin tailed to fat tailed distributions requires more than ``changing the color of the dress.'' Traditional asymptotics deal mainly with either n=1 or n={$\infty$}, and the real world is in between, under the ``laws of the medium numbers''\textendash which vary widely across specific distributions. Both the law of large numbers and the generalized central limit mechanisms operate in highly idiosyncratic ways outside the standard Gaussian or Levy-Stable basins of convergence. A few examples: - The sample mean is rarely in line with the population mean, with effect on ``na\"ive empiricism,'' but can be sometimes be estimated via parametric methods. - The ``empirical distribution'' is rarely empirical. - Parameter uncertainty has compounding effects on statistical metrics. - Dimension reduction (principal components) fails. - Inequality estimators (Gini or quantile contributions) are not additive and produce wrong results. - Many ``biases'' found in psychology become entirely rational under more sophisticated probability distributions. - Most of the failures of financial economics, econometrics, and behavioral economics can be attributed to using the wrong distributions. This book, the first volume of the Technical Incerto, weaves a narrative around published journal articles.},

As GPROF performs precipitation retrievals as a function of surface classes, error characteristics may be dependent on surface types. In this study, we evaluate the rainfall estimates from DPR-Ku as well as GPROF estimates from passive microwave sensors in the GPM constellation. Our evaluation is conducted at the level of individual satellite pixels (5 to 15 km) against three dense networks of rain gauges, located over contrasting land surface types and rainfall regimes, with multiple gauges per satellite pixel and precise accumulation about overpass time to ensure a representative comparison. As expected, we found that the active retrievals from DPR-Ku generally performed better than the passive retrievals from GPROF. However, both retrievals struggle under coastal and semiarid environments. In particular, virga appears to be a serious challenge for both DPR-Ku and GPROF. We detected the existence of lag due to the time it takes for satellite-observed precipitation to reach the ground, but the precise delay is difficult to quantify. We also showed that subpixel variability is a contributor to the errors in GPROF. These results can pinpoint deficiencies in precipitation algorithms that may propagate into widely-used gridded products.}

  abstract = {This study seeks a deeper understanding of the causes of Hadley Cell (HC) expansion, as projected under global warming, and HC contraction, as observed under El Ni\~no. Using an idealized general circulation model, the authors show that a thermal forcing applied to a narrow region around the equator produces ``El Ni\~no\textendash like'' HC contraction, while a forcing with wider meridional extent produces ``global warming\textendash like'' HC expansion. These circulation responses are sensitive primarily to the thermal forcing's meridional structure and are less sensitive to its vertical structure. If the thermal forcing is confined to the midlatitudes, the amount of HC expansion is more than three times that of a forcing of comparable amplitude that is spread over the tropics. This finding may be relevant to recently observed trends of rapid tropical widening.The shift of the HC edge is explained using a very simple model in which the transformed Eulerian mean (TEM) circulation acts to diffuse heat meridionally. In this context, the HC edge is defined as the downward maximum of residual vertical velocity in the upper troposphere ; this corresponds well with the conventional Eulerian definition of the HC edge. In response to a positive thermal forcing, there is anomalous diabatic cooling, and hence anomalous TEM descent, on the poleward flank of the thermal forcing. This causes the HC edge () to shift toward the descending anomaly, so that a narrow forcing causes HC contraction and a wide forcing causes HC expansion.}

These regional variations are closely related to regional changes in large?scale ascent during extreme precipitation events?that is, ?extreme ascent??but the drivers of extreme ascent changes remain poorly understood. Using output from a large ensemble of the Canadian Earth System Model version 2, we show that subtropical changes in extreme ascent likely result from changes in the horizontal scale of ascending anomalies, which are in turn associated with changes in vertical stability. Near the equator, changes in the seasonal mean circulation may be an important factor influencing extreme ascent, but this finding is model dependent.}

  abstract = {The conventional tools of decision-making in water resources infrastructure planning have been developed for problems with well-characterized uncertainties and are ill-suited for problems involving climate nonstationarity. In the past 20years, a predict-then-act-based approach to the incorporation of climate nonstationarity has been widely adopted in which the outputs of bias-corrected climate model projections are used to evaluate planning options. However, the ambiguous nature of results has often proved unsatisfying to decision makers. This paper presents the use of a bottom-up, decision scaling framework for the evaluation of water resources infrastructure design alternatives regarding their robustness to climate change and expected value of performance. The analysis begins with an assessment of the vulnerability of the alternative designs under a wide domain of systematically-generated plausible future climates and utilizes downscaled climate projections ex post to inform likelihoods within a risk-based evaluation. The outcomes under different project designs are compared by way of a set of decision criteria, including the performance under the most likely future, expected value of performance across all evaluated futures and robustness. The method is demonstrated for the design of a hydropower system in sub-Saharan Africa and is compared to the results that would be found using a GCM-based, scenario-led analysis. The results indicate that recommendations from the decision scaling analysis can be substantially different from the scenario-led approach, alleviate common shortcomings related to the use of climate projections in water resources planning, and produce recommendations that are more robust to future climate uncertainty.}

  abstract = {The widespread uncertainty regarding future changes in climate, socioeconomic conditions, and demographics have increased interest in vulnerability-based frameworks for long-term planning of water resources. These frameworks shift the focus from projections of future conditions to the weaknesses of the baseline plans and then to options for reductions in those weaknesses across a wide range of futures. A consistent challenge for vulnerability-based planning is how to assess the relative likelihood of the occurrence of the multidimensional and codependent uncertainties to which the system or plan is vulnerable. This work proposes a methodological solution to the problem, demonstrated in this case as an extension to Decision Scaling framework. The proposed approach first generates a wide range of futures using stochastic simulators, and then stress tests the system across those futures to identify vulnerabilities relative to stakeholder-defined performance thresholds. The relative likelihood of the vulnerabilities is then explored using a Bayesian belief network of the knowledge domain of the water resources system. The Bayesian network provides a formal representation of the joint probabilistic behavior of the system conditioned on the uncertain but potentially useful sources of information about the future, including historical trends, expert judgments, and model-based projections. The proposed approach is applied to compare four design options for a dam project in the Coastal Province of Kenya with respect to the reliability and net present value metrics. Results show that incorporation of belief information helps better distinguishing of the available options, principally by magnifying the differences between the computed net present values.}

  abstract = {Green-grey infrastructures implementation for addressing urban flood damages and urban drainage system' (UDS) resilience (respectively) needs comprehensive evaluation under various planning and design influencing factors. In this paper, a multi-objective decision-making framework is developed for the optimization of green-grey infrastructures to understand the trade-off between benefits and retrofit costs under various design configurations, rainfall intensities, and system performance indicators. In the developed framework, the grey infrastructure locations are optimally determined by using Analytic Hierarchy Process (AHP) method with three defined indicators (e.g., flood volume and flood duration of flooding nodes, sensitivity of flooding nodes) and maximum percentage of each type of green infrastructure (GI) in each sub-catchment based on land-use analysis as a preliminary step of the multi-objective optimization process, followed by decision-making procedure. The application results reveal that optimal designs of grey infrastructure are more cost-effective and may have a significant influence on the reduction of flood damages and outlet peak flow compared to GI from their individual evaluations, while GI improves UDS' functionality performance indicators (e.g., resilience, reliability, and sustainability) better than grey infrastructure. However, a combined implementation of both infrastructures boosts their advantages because of the synchronization effect compared to individual scenarios, providing the most cost-effective optimal UDS designs. Moreover, the cost-effectiveness of coupled green-grey infrastructures designs could be enhanced from lower to higher design storms because of higher rate of utilization of stormwater infiltration and storage capacities of both infrastructures. The framework presented in this study can be conveniently generalized to other case-studies for optimal implementation of green-grey infrastructures as long as including their local economic parameters, climatic patterns, urban development plans and green-grey infrastructures design guidelines.}

Besides a computational performance that is often close to or better than Stan, DynamicPPL provides an intuitive DSL that allows the rapid development of complex dynamic probabilistic programs. Being entirely written in Julia, a high-level dynamic programming language for numerical computing, DynamicPPL inherits a rich set of features available through the Julia ecosystem. Since DynamicPPL is a modular, stand-alone library, any probabilistic programming system written in Julia, such as Turing.jl, can use DynamicPPL to specify models and trace their model parameters. The main features of DynamicPPL are: 1) a meta-programming based DSL for specifying dynamic models using an intuitive tilde-based notation; 2) a tracing data-structure for tracking RVs in dynamic probabilistic models; 3) a rich contextual dispatch system allowing tailored behaviour during model execution; and 4) a user-friendly syntax for probabilistic queries. Finally, we show in a variety of experiments that DynamicPPL, in combination with Turing.jl, achieves computational performance that is often close to or better than Stan.},

  abstract = {We present a physics-informed deep neural network (DNN) method for estimating hydraulic conductivity in saturated and unsaturated flows governed by Darcy's law. For saturated flow, we approximate hydraulic conductivity and head with two DNNs and use Darcy's law in addition to measurements of hydraulic conductivity and head to train these DNNs. For unsaturated flow, we approximate unsaturated conductivity function and capillary pressure with DNNs and train these DNNs using measurements of capillary pressure and the Richards equation. Because it is difficult to measure unsaturated conductivity in the field, we assume that no measurements of unsaturated conductivity are available. The proposed approach enforces the partial differential equation (PDE) (Darcy or Richards equation) constraints by minimizing the PDE residual at select points in the simulation domain. We demonstrate that physics constraints increase the accuracy of DNN approximations of sparsely observed functions and allow for training DNNs when no direct measurements of the functions of interest are available. For the saturated conductivity estimation problem, we show that the physics-informed DNN method is more accurate than the state-of-the-art maximum a posteriori probability method. For the unsaturated flow in homogeneous porous media, we find that the proposed method can accurately estimate the pressure-conductivity relationship based on the capillary pressure measurements only, even in the presence of measurement noise.}

Planning GI is subject to deep uncertainties and requires navigating tradeoffs between multiple objectives. Many-Objective Robust Decision Making (MORDM) can be useful in addressing these modeling challenges. Thus far, MORDM has been used sparsely for GI planning. To help mainstream MORDM applications in GI planning, we developed an open-source Python library: Rhodium-SWMM. Rhodium-SWMM connects the USEPA's Stormwater Management Model (SWMM) to Rhodium, a Python library for MORDM. Rhodium-SWMM provides a generalizable and flexible interface for taking SWMM input files and setting up a multi-objective optimization problem with the ability to define a wide range of parameters in the SWMM input file as uncertainties or levers. This opens opportunities to more conveniently analyze new research questions in multi-scale GI placement under deep uncertainty.}

In most ENSO studies, SST anomalies have been analysed in the 3.4 or 3.0 El Ni\~no regions. Recent analyses have considered different SST anomalies areas in the Pacific, such as ENSO Modoki, which takes into account anomalies in the central Pacific which are bounded by opposite anomalies in the eastern and western Pacific. In order to analyse the influence of different Pacific spatial patterns on South American precipitation and on the Southern Hemisphere atmospheric circulation, composites obtained from Canonical ENSO were compared with those from ENSO Modoki in cases when strong anomalies were present in the Central Pacific. During the Canonical El Ni\~no (La Ni\~na), there tends to be a precipitation increase (decrease) in the La Plata Basin (LPB, 45ᵂ65ᵂ, 15\textsuperscript{S}35\textsuperscript{S}) and a decrease (increase) over northern South America during all seasons. In ENSO Modoki exhibiting strong anomalies in the Central Pacific, these typical patterns are not observed, and in some regions the anomalies even show opposite signs. Precipitation anomaly differences or similarities over South America between the two cases occur in different areas and different seasons. In both cases, differences in tropical South American precipitation during both ENSO types are related to differences in the Walker circulation. In extra-tropical South America, the precipitation differences are due to differences in the Pacific wavetrains and differences in moisture flux intensity over the continent.

  abstract = {Quantifying the potential exposure of property to damages associated with storm surges, extreme weather and hurricanes is fundamental to developing frameworks that can be used to conceive and implement mitigation plans as well as support urban development that accounts for such events. In this study, we aim at quantifying the total value and area of properties exposed to the flooding associated with Hurricane Florence that occurred in September 2018. To this aim, we implement an approach for the identification of affected areas by generating a map of the maximum flood extent obtained from a combination of the flood extent produced by the Federal Emergency Management Agency's (FEMA's) water marks with those obtained from spaceborne radar remote-sensing data. The use of radar in the creation of the flood extent allows for those properties commonly missed by FEMA's interpolation methods, especially from pluvial or non-fluvial sources, and can be used in more accurately estimating the exposure and market value of properties to event-specific flooding. Lastly, we study and quantify how the urban development over the past decades in the regions flooded by Hurricane Florence might have impacted the exposure of properties to present-day storms and floods. This approach is conceptually similar to what experts are addressing as the ``expanding bull's eye effect'', in which ``targets'' of geophysical hazards, such as people and their built environments, enlarge as populations grow and spread. Our results indicate that the total value of property exposed to flooding during Hurricane Florence was USD\&thinsp;52 billion (in 2018 USD), with this value increasing from USD\&thinsp;{$\sim$}10 billion at the beginning of the past century to the final amount based on the expansion of the number of properties exposed. We also found that, despite the decrease in the number of properties built during the decade before Florence, much of the new construction was in proximity to permanent water bodies, hence increasing exposure to flooding. Ultimately, the results of this paper provide a new tool for shedding light on the relationships between urban development in coastal areas and the flooding of those areas, which is estimated to increase in view of projected increasing sea level rise, storm surges and the strength of storms.}

Investing in flood adaptation strategies may reduce the loss of life and livelihood caused by floods3. Where and how floods occur and who is exposed are changing as a result of rapid urbanization4, flood mitigation infrastructure5 and increasing settlements in floodplains6. Previous estimates of the global flood-exposed population have been limited by a lack of observational data, relying instead on models, which have high uncertainty3,7\textendash 11. Here we use daily satellite imagery at 250-metre resolution to estimate flood extent and population exposure for 913 large flood events from 2000 to 2018. We determine a total inundation area of 2.23 million square kilometres, with 255\textendash 290 million people directly affected by floods. We estimate that the total population in locations with satellite-observed inundation grew by 58\textendash 86 million from 2000 to 2015. This represents an increase of 20 to 24 per cent in the proportion of the global population exposed to floods, ten times higher than previous estimates7. Climate change projections for 2030 indicate that the proportion of the population exposed to floods will increase further. The high spatial and temporal resolution of the satellite observations will improve our understanding of where floods are changing and how best to adapt. The global flood database generated from these observations will help to improve vulnerability assessments, the accuracy of global and local flood models, the efficacy of adaptation interventions and our understanding of the interactions between landcover change, climate and floods.},

These organizations, however, often lack decision-relevant, initial screening information across multiple cities to identify which specific city-watershed combinations present not only water-related risks but also potentially attractive opportunities for mitigation via natural infrastructure approaches. To address this need, this paper presents a novel methodology for a continental assessment of the potential for watershed conservation activities to improve surface drinking water quality and mitigate riverine and stormwater flood risks in 70 major cities across Latin America. We used publicly available geospatial data to analyze 887 associated watersheds. Water quality metrics assessed the potential for agricultural practices, afforestation, riparian buffers, and forest conservation to mitigate sediment and phosphorus loads. Flood reduction metrics analyzed the role of increasing infiltration, restoring riparian wetlands, and reducing connected impervious surface to mitigate riverine and stormwater floods for exposed urban populations. Cities were then categorized based on relative opportunity potential to reduce identified risks through watershed conservation activities. We find high opportunities for watershed activities to mitigate at least one of the risks in 42 cities, potentially benefiting 96 million people or around 60\% of the urbanites living in the 70 largest cities in Latin America. We estimate water quality could be improved for 72 million people in 27 cities, riverine flood risk mitigated for 5 million people in 13 cities, and stormwater flooding mitigated for 44 million people in 14 cities. We identified five cities with the potential to simultaneously enhance water quality and mitigate flood risks, and in contrast, six cities where conservation efforts are unlikely to meaningfully mitigate either risk. Institutions investing in natural infrastructure to improve water security in Latin America can maximize their impact by focusing on specific watershed conservation activities either for cleaner drinking water or flood mitigation in cities identified in our analysis where these interventions are most likely to reduce risk.}

Models are typically calibrated against observed discharge and satellite data, but in a developing country context like El Salvador, these data are often unavailable. Even if a model is well calibrated and tested, its ability to influence land use plans requires additional stakeholder engagement. This study uses a participatory modeling approach to calibrate a watershed model and estimate flood impacts of land use scenarios in two urbanizing catchments in El Salvador with a linked land use\textendash catchment hydrology\textendash hydraulic model calibrated on flood height observed by community members. This paper explores both the value of household flood observation in model calibration and differences of flood extent estimates for land use scenarios with an uncalibrated versus community-calibrated model. We find that calibration using household surveys improves model performance. Results of scenario modeling suggest that while past urbanization has significantly increased household flood exposure in one catchment, future land use scenarios that further urbanize or reforest large areas of either catchment have little effect on the number of houses at risk for flooding. The success of the participatory methodology to increase model accuracy and link results to local land use planning makes clear the contribution of social science to traditional hydrological methods to understand land use\textendash flood links in data-poor catchments.}

Here with a hierarchy of climate models, it is demonstrated that extreme ridges in this region are associated with a continuum of zonal wavenumber-5 circumglobal teleconnection patterns that originate from midlatitude atmospheric internal dynamics. Although tropical diabatic heating anomalies are not essential to the formation and maintenance of these wave patterns, certain persistent heating anomalies may double the probability of ridges with amplitudes in the 90th percentile occurring on interannual time scales. Those heating anomalies can be caused by either natural variability or possibly by climate change, and they do not necessarily depend on ENSO. The extreme ridges that occurred during the 2013/14 and 2014/15 winters could be examples of ridges produced by heating anomalies that are not associated with ENSO. This mechanism could provide a source of subseasonal-to-interannual predictability beyond the predictability provided by ENSO.}

Results indicate that low-income households must spend an average of 9.7\% of their disposable income and/or work 9.5 h at minimum wage to pay for basic monthly water and sewer service but also that these values vary considerably across the country. Community-level demographic and economic data are used to identify some correlates of affordability. Region, utility size, and local income inequality emerge as strong correlates of affordability.}

  abstract = {This study uses contemporary metrics and data from an original, representative sample of water and sewer utilities in the United States to calculate the affordability of basic single-family residential water and sewer services for low-income households in 2019. Results show that affordability conditions have worsened on average since the last such study in 2017: low-income households must spend an average of 12.4\% of their disposable income (up from 10.9\%) and/or work 10.1 h at minimum wage (up from 9.9 h) to pay for basic monthly water and sewer services. Analysis suggests that rising prices combine with underlying economic trends to exacerbate affordability.}

  abstract = {From the Derg's restoration of Meskel Square for its military parades and Meles Zenawi's Light-Rail Transit (LRT) and condominium social housing projects to Abiy Ahmed's high-end luxury real estate and urban tourism schemes, megaprojects have collapsed Ethiopia's political history into an urban bricolage of shifting ideologies and new priorities. At this critical juncture, where questions of political rupture and continuity become salient, this paper examines what we can learn about Ethiopia's political dynamics through its latest urban megaprojects. Drawing on `LaGare' and `Beautifying Sheger' as case studies, this article argues that there is a new urban aesthetic emerging in Addis Ababa targeting domestic elites, the Ethiopian diaspora and tourists. Prime Minister Abiy Ahmed's Gulf-emulated luxury real estate projects and major riverside renewal schemes are intended to generate revenue through increased land values and urban tourism. At the same time, issues around inclusive consultation with local stakeholders, the lack of coordination with the relevant bureaucracies and the highly centralized decision-making process are reminiscent of the modus operandi of previous Ethiopian regimes. These urban megaprojects are useful analytical lenses to disentangle political rupture from operational continuity.}

With zero knowledge built in at the start of learning (i.e., given only a ``raw'' description of the board state), the network learns to play at a strong intermediate level. Furthermore, when a set of hand-crafted features is added to the network's input representation, the result is a truly staggering level of performance: the latest version of TD-Gammon is now estimated to play at a strong master level that is extremely close to the world's best human players.}

  abstract = {This paper compares the inherent notions of justice in four different approaches to flood risk management in Europe. As protection against flood risks becomes increasingly difficult, dilemmas of justice emerge: some benefits from flood protection measures whereas others loose. Decisions on whom to protect differentiate between upstream and downstream or left and right side of a river. This raises a central but barely discussed conflict: what (or rather who) should be protected against inundations? This question deals in essence with justice. Justice concerns questions over fairness in the allocation of resources, capital and wealth across different members of society. There are different and contradicting concepts of justice, which differ in interpretations of fair resource allocation and distributions. `What's the right thing to protect' is thus a question of concepts of justice. This contribution is not an attempt to answer this fundamental question, but it offers a debate on how different concepts of justice provide different answers. These answers will then be related to flood risk management approaches in England, the Netherlands, Germany, and Austria.}

  abstract = {Recently, graph neural networks have been gaining a lot of attention to simulate dynamical systems due to their inductive nature leading to zero-shot generalizability. Similarly, physics-informed inductive biases in deep-learning frameworks have been shown to give superior performance in learning the dynamics of physical systems. There is a growing volume of literature that attempts to combine these two approaches. Here, we evaluate the performance of thirteen different graph neural networks, namely, Hamiltonian and Lagrangian graph neural networks, graph neural ODE, and their variants with explicit constraints and different architectures. We briefly explain the theoretical formulation highlighting the similarities and differences in the inductive biases and graph architecture of these systems. We evaluate these models on spring, pendulum, gravitational, and 3D deformable solid systems to compare the performance in terms of rollout error, conserved quantities such as energy and momentum, and generalizability to unseen system sizes. Our study demonstrates that GNNs with additional inductive biases, such as explicit constraints and decoupling of kinetic and potential energies, exhibit significantly enhanced performance. Further, all the physics-informed GNNs exhibit zero-shot generalizability to system sizes an order of magnitude larger than the training system, thus providing a promising route to simulate large-scale realistic systems.},

  abstract = {Direct damage from flooding at residential properties has typically been categorized as insured, with liabilities accruing to insurers, or uninsured, with costs accruing to property owners. However, residential flooding can also expose lenders and local governments to financial risk, though the distribution of this risk is not well understood. Flood losses are not limited to direct damages, but also include indirect effects such as decreases in property values, which can be substantial, though are rarely well quantified. The combination of direct damage and property value decrease influences rates of mortgage default and property abandonment in the wake of a flood, creating financial risk. In this research, property-level data on sales, mortgages, and insurance claims are used in combination with machine learning techniques and geostatistical methods to provide estimates of flood losses that are then utilized to evaluate the risk of default and abandonment in eastern North Carolina following Hurricane Florence (2018). Within the study area, Hurricane Florence generated \textbackslash 366M in observed insured damages and an estimated \textbackslash 1.77B in combined uninsured damages and property value decreases. Property owners, lenders, and local governments were exposed to an additional \$562M in potential losses due to increased rates of default and abandonment. Areas with lower pre-flood property values were exposed to greater risk than areas with higher valued properties. Results suggest more highly resolved estimates of a flooding event's systemic financial risk may be useful in developing improved flood resilience strategies.},

Local historical point rainfall series often cover several decades, which makes it possible to estimate rainfall means at different timescales, and to assess return periods of extreme events. Due to climate change, however, these series are most likely not representative of future rainfall. There is therefore a demand for climate-projected long rainfall series, which can represent a specific region and rainfall pattern as well as fulfil requirements of long rainfall series which includes climate changes projected to a specific future period. {$<$}br{$><$}br{$>$} This paper presents a framework for resampling of historical point rainfall series in order to generate synthetic rainfall series, which has the same statistical properties as an original series. Using a number of key target predictions for the future climate, such as winter and summer precipitation, and representation of extreme events, the resampled historical series are projected to represent rainfall properties in a future climate. Climate-projected rainfall series are simulated by brute force randomization of model parameters, which leads to a large number of projected series. In order to evaluate and select the rainfall series with matching statistical properties as the key target projections, an extensive evaluation procedure is developed.{$<$}/p{$>$}}

Water systems faced extensive challenges due to cascading failures across multiple interdependent infrastructure systems. Water utilities have since made considerable progress in improving resilience to extreme events, but ongoing challenges remain. Through a qualitative analysis of semi-structured interviews with 20 large water utilities in Texas, this study tracks the evolution of water infrastructure resilience across three phases: the storm and immediate aftermath, the subsequent one-year period, and the ``new normal'' in the post-disaster environment. We consider five dimensions of resilience\textemdash economic, environmental, governance, infrastructure, and social\textemdash to identify where solutions have been implemented and where barriers remain. This study contributes to efforts throughout the United States to build more robust water systems by capturing lessons learned from Winter Storm Uri and providing recommendations to improve hazard preparedness, resilience, and public health.}

In order to limit climate warming to below 2 \textdegree C, or even 1.5 \textdegree C, it must undergo a rapid transition towards carbon neutral production by the mid-century. Simultaneously, electricity generating technologies will be vulnerable to climate change. Here, we assess the impacts of climate change on wind, solar photovoltaic, hydro and thermoelectric power generation in Europe using a consistent modelling approach across the different technologies. We compare the impacts for different global warming scenarios: +1.5 \textdegree C, +2 \textdegree C and +3 \textdegree C. Results show that climate change has negative impacts on electricity production in most countries and for most technologies. Such impacts remain limited for a 1.5 \textdegree C warming, and roughly double for a 3 \textdegree C warming. Impacts are relatively limited for solar photovoltaic and wind power potential which may reduce up to 10\%, while hydropower and thermoelectric generation may decrease by up to 20\%. Generally, impacts are more severe in southern Europe than in northern Europe, inducing inequity between EU countries. We show that a higher share of renewables could reduce the vulnerability of power generation to climate change, although the variability of wind and solar PV production remains a significant challenge.}

  abstract = {Climate change may alter the geographical pattern and intensity of near-surface winds which are the ``fuel'' for wind turbines. In a context of fast current and planned development of wind power worldwide, investigating the impacts of climate change on wind power generation is necessary. This study aims at assessing future changes in the potential for wind power generation over the whole Europe and in the effective wind power production from national wind farms operating at the end of 2012 and planned by 2020. For this purpose, a simplified wind power generation model is applied to an ensemble of 15 regional climate projections achieved from 10 Regional Climate Models downscaling six Global Climate Models under the SRES A1B emission scenario from the ENSEMBLES project. The use of a relatively large multi-model ensemble allows the identification of robust changes and the estimation of a range of uncertainties associated with projected changes. We show with a high level of confidence that, under the A1B scenario, over most of Europe, changes in wind power potential will remain within {$\pm$}15 and {$\pm$}20~\% by mid and late century respectively. Overall, we find a tendency toward a decrease of the wind power potential over Mediterranean areas and an increase over Northern Europe. Changes in multi-year power production will not exceed 5 and 15~\% in magnitude at the European and national scale respectively for both wind farms in operation at the end of 2012 and planned by 2020. Therefore, climate change should neither undermine nor favor wind energy development in Europe. However, accounting for climate change effects in particular regions may help optimize the wind power development and energy mix plans.}

  abstract = {Building bridges between environmental and political agendas is essential nowadays in face of the increasing human pressure on natural environments, including wetlands. Wetlands provide critical ecosystem services for humanity and can generate a considerable direct or indirect income to the local communities. To meet many of the sustainable development goals, we need to move our trajectory from the current environmental destructive development to a wiser wetland use. The current article contain a proposed agenda for the Pantanal aiming the improvement of public policy for conservation in the Pantanal, one of the largest, most diverse, and continuous inland wetland in the world. We suggest and discuss a list of 11 essential interfaces between science, policy, and development in region linked to the proposed agenda. We believe that a functional science network can booster the collaborative capability to generate creative ideas and solutions to address the big challenges faced by the Pantanal wetland.}

Given hydrological inflows, Pywr simulates customisable water allocation and operation rules throughout complex multi-purpose managed water systems at each user-defined time-step. The model uses a low-level interface to existing linear programming solvers for fast priority-based optimisation-driven simulation. The library uses an object based system for users to provide input data and record simulation outputs. A novel multi-scenario simulation method provides an almost 4-fold improvement in model run-times and supports calculating robustness metrics across scenarios. A flexible interface to specify multi-objective optimisation formulations as part of a model's input file is included. These features enable analysts to apply advanced water planning approaches, such as robust decision making and robust optimisation, to real systems. The library is available under the GPLv3 open source licence, includes several examples and a regression test suite.}

This dynamism will change due to climate change and the near-ubiquitous human control of river flows globally, which may have severe effects on species distributions and interactions. We employed a combination of population modelling and network theory to explore the consequences of possible flow regime futures on riparian plant communities, including scenarios of increased drought, flooding and flow homogenization (removal of flow variability). We found that even slight modifications to the historic natural flow regime had significant consequences for the structure of riparian plant networks. Networks of emergent interactions between plant guilds were most connected at the natural flow regime and became simplified with increasing flow alteration. The most influential component of flow alteration was flood reduction, with drought and flow homogenization both having greater simplifying community-wide consequences than increased flooding. These findings suggest that maintaining floods under future climates will be needed to overcome the negative long-term consequences of flow modification on riverine ecosystems.}

  abstract = {The Joint-Probability Method (JPM) was adopted by federal agencies for critical post-Katrina determinations of hurricane surge frequencies. In standard JPM implementations, it is necessary to consider a very large number of combinations of storm parameters, and each such combination (or synthetic storm) requires the simulation of wind, waves, and surge. The tools used to model the wave and surge phenomena have improved greatly in recent years, but this improvement and the use of very large high-resolution grids have made the computations both time-consuming and expensive. In order to ease the computational burden, two independent approaches have been developed to reduce the number of storm surge simulations that are required. Both of these so-called JPM-OS (JPM-Optimal Sampling) methods seek to accurately cover the entire storm parameter space through optimum selection of a small number of parameter values so as to minimize the number of required storm simulations. Tests done for the Mississippi coast showed that the accuracy of the two methods is comparable to that of a full JPM analysis, with a reduction of an order of magnitude or more in the computational effort.}

  abstract = {Green Infrastructure (GI) location planning involves multi-objective spatial analysis considering simultaneous benefits. Fast optimization results are often required (e.g., collaborative modeling exercises and stakeholder involvement workshops), while the simulation-optimization approach is impractical for these cases if it relies on time-consuming simulations of complex drainage system models. This paper proposes a new method using a surrogated model based upon targeted executions of a more complex urban drainage model. This method uses a piece-wise linear interpolation to predict the hydrological impact of individual impervious-to-pervious area changes and the Mixed Integer Linear Optimization to find the optimal location of GI practices. We applied the methodology to the capital city of Colombia, Bogot\'a, with the objectives of reducing runoff, combined sewer overflows (CSOs), and separate sanitary overflows (SSOs). Two multi-objective optimization approaches (i.e., a lexicographic and a weighted-sum model) were explored, showing the high efficiency of this approach in building Pareto Fronts and rapidly suggesting alternative solutions for different budgets. It was found that by implementing GIs on one-third of the city's GI-feasible public areas (2.2\% of city area), under a 10-year 6-h rainfall event, the total reduction on runoff, CSO, and SSO are 0.9\%, 1.8\%, and 2.4\%, respectively. These results show the importance of promoting GI among private-land owners, especially in cities with land predominantly private-owned. This new approach is particularly useful for applications under data scarcity and high-uncertainty scenarios.}

The provision of water supplies and sanitation services in an efficient, equitable and timely manner presents a formidable management and investment challenges, which simply cannot be met under the existing conditions. The current approach has been almost exclusively on supply management: demand management practices have received inadequate attention. Unless the current management practices change radically, future solutions will require higher investment costs to transport more water from increasingly distant and expensive sources, with serious adverse economic, social and environmental impacts on the exporting regions and higher land subsidence rates in ZMCM due to ever-increasing groundwater withdrawals, among many others factors. It is essential to formulate a long-term integrated management plan, which does not exist at present, and which considers linkages to policies on urban development (an issue basically ignored thus far), migration, industry, energy, public health and environment. It is not an easy task, but, nevertheless, it is an essential one.}

The dynamical simulation model HiREPS of the Austrian and German electricity, heating and cooling sectors was used for this analysis. The electricity generation cost and changes in the required secured capacity were used as indicators for the resilience of the energy system. The results show, that the analysed changes in the natural gas price have larger impact on the electricity generation cost than weather variability between different years or climate change. Especially the fossil fuel based scenario showed high sensitivity to the gas price. Analysis of the required secured capacity shows, that in the last quarter of the 21st century the annual maximum residual loads are growing and are dominated by strong cooling demand peaks. Promoting passive cooling options, efficient building designs and options for a controlled down regulation of cooling devices seems to be advisable to avoid installing large thermal power plant backup capacities. The evaluated climate model simulations show only small changes in photovoltaic, wind and hydro power generation for 2051-2080 in Austria and Germany.}

  abstract = {There is a direct influence of global warming on precipitation. Increased heating leads to greater evaporation and thus surface drying, thereby increasing the intensity and duration of drought. However, the water holding capacity of air increases by about 7\% per 1\textdegree C warming, which leads to increased water vapor in the atmosphere. Hence, storms, whether individual thunderstorms, extratropical rain or snow storms, or tropical cyclones, supplied with increased moisture, produce more intense precipitation events. Such events are observed to be widely occurring, even where total precipitation is decreasing: `it never rains but it pours!' This increases the risk of flooding. The atmospheric and surface energy budget plays a critical role in the hydrological cycle, and also in the slower rate of change that occurs in total precipitation than total column water vapor. With modest changes in winds, patterns of precipitation do not change much, but result in dry areas becoming drier (generally throughout the subtropics) and wet areas becoming wetter, especially in the mid- to high latitudes: the `rich get richer and the poor get poorer'. This pattern is simulated by climate models and is projected to continue into the future. Because, with warming, more precipitation occurs as rain instead of snow and snow melts earlier, there is increased runoff and risk of flooding in early spring, but increased risk of drought in summer, especially over continental areas. However, with more precipitation per unit of upward motion in the atmosphere, i.e. `more bang for the buck', atmospheric circulation weakens, causing monsoons to falter. In the tropics and subtropics, precipitation patterns are dominated by shifts as sea surface temperatures change, with El Ni\~no a good example. The volcanic eruption of Mount Pinatubo in 1991 led to an unprecedented drop in land precipitation and runoff, and to widespread drought, as precipitation shifted from land to oceans and evaporation faltered, providing lessons for possible geoengineering. Most models simulate precipitation that occurs prematurely and too often, and with insufficient intensity, resulting in recycling that is too large and a lifetime of moisture in the atmosphere that is too short, which affects runoff and soil moisture.}

  abstract = {A global perspective is developed on a number of high impact climate extremes in 2010 through diagnostic studies of the anomalies, diabatic heating, and global energy and water cycles that demonstrate relationships among variables and across events. Natural variability, especially ENSO, and global warming from human influences together resulted in very high sea surface temperatures (SSTs) in several places that played a vital role in subsequent developments. Record high SSTs in the Northern Indian Ocean in May 2010, the Gulf of Mexico in August 2010, the Caribbean in September 2010, and north of Australia in December 2010 provided a source of unusually abundant atmospheric moisture for nearby monsoon rains and flooding in Pakistan, Colombia, and Queensland. The resulting anomalous diabatic heating in the northern Indian and tropical Atlantic Oceans altered the atmospheric circulation by forcing quasi-stationary Rossby waves and altering monsoons. The anomalous monsoonal circulations had direct links to higher latitudes: from Southeast Asia to southern Russia, and from Colombia to Brazil. Strong convection in the tropical Atlantic in northern summer 2010 was associated with a Rossby wave train that extended into Europe creating anomalous cyclonic conditions over the Mediterranean area while normal anticyclonic conditions shifted downstream where they likely interacted with an anomalously strong monsoon circulation, helping to support the persistent atmospheric anticyclonic regime over Russia. This set the stage for the ``blocking'' anticyclone and associated Russian heat wave and wild fires. Attribution is limited by shortcomings in models in replicating monsoons, teleconnections and blocking.}

  abstract = {From a societal, weather, and climate perspective, precipitation intensity, duration, frequency, and phase are as much of concern as total amounts, as these factors determine the disposition of precipitation once it hits the ground and how much runs off. At the extremes of precipitation incidence are the events that give rise to floods and droughts, whose changes in occurrence and severity have an enormous impact on the environment and society. Hence, advancing understanding and the ability to model and predict the character of precipitation is vital but requires new approaches to examining data and models. Various mechanisms, storms and so forth, exist to bring about precipitation. Because the rate of precipitation, conditional on when it falls, greatly exceeds the rate of replenishment of moisture by surface evaporation, most precipitation comes from moisture already in the atmosphere at the time the storm begins, and transport of moisture by the storm-scale circulation into the storm is vital....}

  abstract = {An approximate formulation of how much moisture that precipitates out comes from local evaporation versus horizontal transport, referred to as ``recycling,'' has allowed new estimates of recycling to be mapped globally as a function of length scale. The recycling is formulated in terms of the ``intensity of the hydrological cycle'' I, which is alternatively referred to as a ``precipitation efficiency'' as it denotes the fraction of moisture flowing through a region that is precipitated out, and a ``moistening efficiency,'' M, which is defined as the fraction of moisture evaporated from a region to that flowing through. While datasets of the pertinent quantities have improved, they still contain uncertainties. Results show that often the intensity is not greatest at times of greatest precipitation because moisture transport into the region is also a maximum, especially in the monsoonal regions. The annual cycle variations of I are fairly small over North America and Europe while large seasonal variations in M occur in most places. Seasonal mean maps of precipitation, evaporation (E), and atmospheric moisture transport are presented and discussed along with the seasonal and annual means of derived precipitation and moisture efficiencies and the recycling fraction. The recycling results depend greatly on the scale of the domain under consideration and global maps of the recycling for seasonal and annual means are produced for 500- and 1000-km scales that therefore allow the heterogeneity of the fields across river basins to be captured. Global annual mean recycling for 500-km scales is 9.6\%, consisting of 8.9\% over land and 9.9\% over the oceans. Even for 1000-km scales, less than 20\% of the annual precipitation typically comes from evaporation within that domain. Over the Amazon, strong advection of moisture dominates the supply of atmospheric moisture over much of the river basin but local evaporation is much more prominent over the southern parts, and, for the annual cycle as a whole, about 34\% of the moisture is recycled. Over the Mississippi Basin, the recycling is about 21\%. The smaller number mostly reflects the smaller domain size. Relatively high annual values of recycling ({$>$}20\%) occur in the subtropical highs, where E is high and the advective moisture flux is small, and in convergence zones where, again, the advective moisture flux is small. Low annual values occur over the southern oceans, the North Pacific, and the eastern equatorial Pacific, where the moisture flux is at a maximum.}

  abstract = {Quantifying flood hazard is an essential component of resilience planning, emergency response, and mitigation, including insurance. Traditionally undertaken at catchment and national scales, recently, efforts have intensified to estimate flood risk globally to better allow consistent and equitable decision making. Global flood hazard models are now a practical reality, thanks to improvements in numerical algorithms, global datasets, computing power, and coupled modelling frameworks. Outputs of these models are vital for consistent quantification of global flood risk and in projecting the impacts of climate change. However, the urgency of these tasks means that outputs are being used as soon as they are made available and before such methods have been adequately tested. To address this, we compare multi-probability flood hazard maps for Africa from six global models and show wide variation in their flood hazard, economic loss and exposed population estimates, which has serious implications for model credibility. While there is around 30\%\textendash 40\% agreement in flood extent, our results show that even at continental scales, there are significant differences in hazard magnitude and spatial pattern between models, notably in deltas, arid/semi-arid zones and wetlands. This study is an important step towards a better understanding of modelling global flood hazard, which is urgently required for both current risk and climate change projections.}

  abstract = {This study contributes the Deep Uncertainty (DU) Pathways framework for bridging long-term water supply infrastructure investments and improved short-term water portfolio management (e.g., restrictions, water transfers, financial instruments, etc.) to yield a regional water supply policy robust to supply and financial failures. The DU Pathways framework combines flexibility-providing risk-of-failure (ROF) decision rules, dynamic adaptive policy pathways concepts, and a careful consideration of time-evolving information feedbacks to yield management-conditioned infrastructure pathways for regions. The DU Pathways' framework has been developed to carefully consider multi-actor regional contexts with the goal of aiding stakeholders in discovering pathway policies that attain high performance levels for supply reliability and financial stability across challenging, deeply uncertain futures and to guide robustness compromises that may be necessary between regional actors. As demonstrated in the Research Triangle region of North Carolina, DU Pathways clarifies how to identify robust infrastructure investment and management policies across the municipalities of Raleigh, Durham, Cary, and Chapel Hill. Our results provide insights about the most cost-effective infrastructure options to be pursued in the near-term, clarify which sources of uncertainty drive the performance tradeoffs and robustness conflicts across the regional system, and demonstrate valuable information on the diversity of interdependent failure modes that may emerge across the multiple actors implementing each candidate policy.}

  abstract = {Financial risk, access to capital, regulatory processes, and regional competition for limited water sources represent dominant concerns in the United States as well as the broader global water supply sector. This work introduces the WaterPaths simulation software: a generalizable, cloud-compatible, open-source exploratory modeling system designed to inform long-term regional investments in water infrastructure while simultaneously aiding regions to improve their short-term weekly management decisions, often made in response to droughts. Uniquely, WaterPaths has the capability to identify coordinated planning and management for groups of water utilities sharing water resources. WaterPaths' exploits dynamic and adaptive risk-of-failure (ROF) rules to trigger management and planning actions in temporally consistent pathways. The compact and efficient ROF-based representation of decision pathways allows WaterPaths to scale efficiently with the number of regional actors and their candidate actions. Lastly, as a platform for supporting decision making under deep uncertainty, WaterPaths accounts for a broad range of uncertainties including hydrological or climate extremes, permitting time, demand growth, effectiveness of water-use restrictions, construction costs, and financing uncertainties. To demonstrate the capabilities of WaterPaths, we introduce a new hypothetical water resources test case, the Sedento Valley. The Sedento Valley test case contains three resource-sharing water utilities that seek to regionally coordinate their policies for drought mitigation and infrastructure investment. The three utilities are challenged by a diverse set of deep uncertainties that encompass natural and human systems stressors. The Sedento Valley test case contributes a new opportunity for benchmarking decision-support tools and water-resources systems simulation software.}

  abstract = {Emerging water scarcity concerns in many urban regions are associated with several deeply uncertain factors, including rapid population growth, limited coordination across adjacent municipalities and the increasing risks for sustained regional droughts. Managing these uncertainties will require that regional water utilities identify coordinated, scarcity-mitigating strategies that trigger the appropriate actions needed to avoid water shortages and financial instabilities. This research focuses on the Research Triangle area of North Carolina, seeking to engage the water utilities within Raleigh, Durham, Cary and Chapel Hill in cooperative and robust regional water portfolio planning. Prior analysis of this region through the year 2025 has identified significant regional vulnerabilities to volumetric shortfalls and financial losses. Moreover, efforts to maximize the individual robustness of any of the mentioned utilities also have the potential to strongly degrade the robustness of the others. This research advances a multi-stakeholder Many-Objective Robust Decision Making (MORDM) framework to better account for deeply uncertain factors when identifying cooperative drought management strategies. Our results show that appropriately designing adaptive risk-of-failure action triggers required stressing them with a comprehensive sample of deeply uncertain factors in the computational search phase of MORDM. Search under the new ensemble of states-of-the-world is shown to fundamentally change perceived performance tradeoffs and substantially improve the robustness of individual utilities as well as the overall region to water scarcity. Search under deep uncertainty enhanced the discovery of how cooperative water transfers, financial risk mitigation tools, and coordinated regional demand management must be employed jointly to improve regional robustness and decrease robustness conflicts between the utilities. Insights from this work have general merit for regions where adjacent municipalities can benefit from cooperative regional water portfolio planning.}

In the paper it is claimed that all such decision ``theories'' share a common methodological feature, which is the use of formal and abstract languages as well as of a model of rationality. Different decision aiding approaches can thus be defined, depending on the origin of the model of rationality used in the decision aiding process. The concept of decision aiding process is then introduced and analysed. The paper's ultimate claim is that all such decision aiding approaches can be seen as part of a decision aiding methodology.}

Land system architecture, interacting with the landscape mosaic approach in ecology, offers a special niche for the entry of rural areas and wildlands into urban sustainability research through examinations of the composition and configuration of `cityscapes'. Given the fine-grain data requirements of heterogeneous cityscapes, emergent land architecture-mosaic approaches have largely explored the urban heat island (UHI) problem, a topic that links LSS with the interests of urban climatology, engineering, and planning in city morphology or geometry. The subtle distinctions in the treatment of land configuration between land architecture-mosaic approaches and urban morphology-geometry approaches are identified. Several examples of the land architecture-mosaic approach illustrate the understanding gained about the UHI problem as well as its complementarity with morphology-geometry approaches. This understanding provides insights about the design of urban areas at the parcel to neighborhood scales to ameliorate extreme temperatures, an issue of increasing concern for urban areas worldwide and consistent with the sustainability problems identified by such international programs as Future Earth.}

Here we explore the possible consequences of these impacts for the electricity supply sector at the global scale. Regional hydropower projections are developed by forcing a coupled global hydrological and dam model with downscaled, bias-corrected climate realizations. Consequent impacts on power sector composition and associated emissions and investment costs are explored using the Global Change Assessment Model (GCAM). We find that climate-driven changes in hydropower generation may shift power demands onto and away from carbon intensive technologies. This causes significantly altered power sector CO2 emissions in several hydro-dependent regions, although the net global impact is modest. For drying regions, we estimate a global, cumulative investment need of approximately one trillion dollars ({$\pm\$$}500 billion) this century to make up for deteriorated hydropower generation caused by climate change. Total investments avoided are of a similar magnitude across regions projected to experience increased precipitation. Investment risks and opportunities are concentrated in hydro-dependent countries for which significant climate change is expected. Various countries throughout the Balkans, Latin America and Southern Africa are most vulnerable, whilst Norway, Canada, and Bhutan emerge as clear beneficiaries.}

  abstract = {How has the Atlantic Meridional Overturning Circulation (AMOC) varied over the past centuries and what is the risk of an anthropogenic AMOC collapse?We report probabilistic projections of the future climate which improve on previous AMOC projection studies by (i) greatly expanding the considered observational constraints and (ii) carefully sampling the tail areas of the parameter probability distribution function (pdf).We use a Bayesian inversion to constrain a simple model of the coupled climate, carbon cycle and AMOC systems using observations to derive multicentury hindcasts and projections.Our hindcasts show considerable skill in representing the observational constraints. We show that robust AMOC risk estimates can require carefully sampling the parameter pdfs. We find a low probability of experiencing an AMOC collapse within the 21st century for a business-as-usual emissions scenario. The probability of experiencing an AMOC collapse within two centuries is 1/10. The probability of crossing a forcing threshold and triggering a future AMOC collapse (by 2300) is approximately 1/30 in the 21st century and over 1/3 in the 22nd. Given the simplicity of the model structure and uncertainty in the forcing assumptions, our analysis should be considered a proof of concept and the quantitative conclusions subject to severe caveats.}

  abstract = {The Coastal Texas Protection and Ecosystem Restoration Feasibility Study, also known as the Coastal Texas Study, was undertaken to determine the feasibility of constructing coastal storm risk management and ecosystem restoration features using a multiple lines of defense strategy along the Texas coast. The project feature selection process resulted in six coastal storm risk management options and nine large-scale ecosystem restoration features that were evaluated for engineering, economic and environmental viability and reviewed under the National Environmental Policy Act, to determine feasibility for Congressional consideration. The Final Environmental Impact Statement (FEIS) discloses the anticipated effects to the natural and human environment from the alternatives considered based on the best available information at the time of publication. The EIS employs a tiered-NEPA approach in which full environmental compliance with NEPA and environmental laws has been demonstrated for ``actionable measures,'' which primarily consist of ecosystem restoration actions where the impacts and designs are well understood and minimal changes are anticipated during the preconstruction, engineering design (PED) phase. For measures referred to as Tier One measures, some uncertainty remains on the design of the measure or additional modeling is needed to fully understand and quantify the effects of the action, so the disclosure of impacts at this phase is an overview of the worst-case scenario to give the decision maker a full understanding of the possible impacts. For these measures, additional NEPA will be completed during PED to more accurately disclose the impacts based on refined designs and updated modeling. Significant impacts to natural resources are expected with implementation of the coastal storm risk management measures (CSRM), while impacts would be less than significant for ecosystem restoration (ER) measures.},

  abstract = {Hurricane Harvey reached Category 4 when it made landfall on the coast of Texas in late August 2017. Harvey not only affected the coastal region with wind speeds that peaked near 50\,m/s, it also dumped \textasciitilde 7.6\,\texttimes\,1010\,m3 of rain over 3\,days. This rainfall was equivalent to the discharge of the Amazon River over the same period and made Harvey the wettest tropical cyclone to affect the United States. Winds and rainfall interacted to produce atypical storm surges along the coast and estuaries of Texas and compound flooding in the Houston region. Data from the NOAA's Center for Operational Oceanographic Products and Services provided information on water levels in this region. The highest water levels, 3\,m above predicted, occurred from August 27th to 29th at Buffalo Bayou in the uppermost reaches of the Galveston-Trinity-Tabbs-Burnet Bay system. The peak surge occurred on Aug 29th because of the triple punch of a) the ocean wind stress and corresponding surge, plus the rainfall-related land-derived discharge from b) Buffalo Bayou and then from c) the San Jacinto River. Winds from the ocean persisted during that 3-day period and drove onshore water transport. This transport, together with anomalously high mean sea levels and the coastline modifications in the upper bay system, delayed the seaward motion of the land-derived discharge. Numerical model simulations that turned forcings on and off, highlighted the importance of the two river pulses in causing the widespread flooding. Simulations also underscored the influence of the interaction between land-derived discharge and ocean-derived surge along different parts of the Houston-Galveston Bay system.}

  abstract = {Large, complex coastal regions often require a combination of interventions to lower the risk of flooding to an acceptable level. In practice, a limited number of strategies are considered and interdependencies between interventions are often simplified. This paper presents the Multiple Lines of Defence Optimization System (MODOS)-model. This quick, probabilistic model simulates and evaluates the impact of many flood risk reduction strategies while accounting for interdependencies amongst measures. The simulation includes hydraulic calculations, damage calculations, and the effects of measures for various return periods. The application and potential of this model is shown with a conceptual and simplified case study, based on the Houston-Galveston Bay area. The analyses demonstrate how the MODOS-model identifies trade-offs within the system and shows how flood risk, cost, and impact respond to flood management decisions. This improved understanding of the impact of design and planning choices can benefit the discussions in finding the optimal flood risk reduction strategy for coastal regions.}

  abstract = {Coastal cities combine intensive socioeconomic activities and investments with high exposure to flood hazards. Developing effective strategies to manage flood risk in coastal cities is often a costly and complicated process. In designing strategies, engineers rely on computationally demanding flood simulation models, but they can only compare a limited number of strategies due to computational constraints. This limits the efficacy of standard flood simulation models in the crucial conceptual phase of flood risk management. This paper presents the Flood Risk Reduction Evaluation and Screening (FLORES) model, which provides useful risk information in this early conceptual phase. FLORES rapidly performs numerous simulations and compares the impact of many storms, strategies, and future scenarios. This article presents FLORES and demonstrates its merits in a case study for Beira, Mozambique. Our results demonstrate that expansion of the drainage capacity and strengthening of its coastal protection in the southwest are crucial components of any effective flood risk management strategy for Beira.}

  abstract = {Selecting an appropriate set of confounders for which to control is critical for reliable causal inference. Recent theoretical and methodological developments have helped clarify a number of principles of confounder selection. When complete knowledge of a causal diagram relating all covariates to each other is available, graphical rules can be used to make decisions about covariate control. Unfortunately, such complete knowledge is often unavailable. This paper puts forward a practical approach to confounder selection decisions when the somewhat less stringent assumption is made that knowledge is available for each covariate whether it is a cause of the exposure, and whether it is a cause of the outcome. Based on recent theoretically justified developments in the causal inference literature, the following proposal is made for covariate control decisions: control for each covariate that is a cause of the exposure, or of the outcome, or of both; exclude from this set any variable known to be an instrumental variable; and include as a covariate any proxy for an unmeasured variable that is a common cause of both the exposure and the outcome. Various principles of confounder selection are then further related to statistical covariate selection methods.}

  abstract = {To mitigate climate change a renewable energy transition is needed. Existing power systems will need to be redesigned to balance variable renewable energy production with variable energy demand. We investigate the meteorological sensitivity of a highly-renewable European energy system using large ensemble simulations from two global climate models. Based on 3\texttimes 2000 years of simulated weather conditions, daily wind and solar energy yields, and energy demand are calculated. From this data, 1-, 7- and 14-days events of extreme low renewable energy production and extreme high energy shortfall are selected. Energy shortfall is defined as the residual load, i.e. demand minus renewable production. 1-day low energy production days are characterised by large-scale high pressure systems over central Europe, with lower than normal wind speeds. These events typically occur in winter when solar energy is limited due to short day lengths. Situations of atmospheric blocking lead to long lasting periods of low energy production, such 7- and 14-days low production events peak late summer. High energy shortfall events occur due to comparable high pressure systems though now combined with below normal temperatures, driving up energy demand. In contrast to the low energy production events, 1-, 7- and 14-days high shortfall events all occur mid-winter, locked to the coldest months of the year. A spatial redistribution of wind turbines and solar panels cannot prevent these high-impact events, options to import renewable energy from remote locations during these events are limited. Projected changes due to climate change are substantially smaller than interannual variability. Future power systems with large penetration of variable renewable energy must be designed with these events in mind.}

It was not previously known whether, in practice, such overestimations are common, whether they harm performance, and whether they can generally be prevented. In this paper, we answer all these questions affirmatively. In particular, we first show that the recent DQN algorithm, which combines Q-learning with a deep neural network, suffers from substantial overestimations in some games in the Atari 2600 domain. We then show that the idea behind the Double Q-learning algorithm, which was introduced in a tabular setting, can be generalized to work with large-scale function approximation. We propose a specific adaptation to the DQN algorithm and show that the resulting algorithm not only reduces the observed overestimations, as hypothesized, but that this also leads to much better performance on several games.},

  abstract = {Worldwide, 98\% of total electricity is currently produced by thermoelectric power and hydropower. Climate change is expected to directly impact electricity supply, in terms of both water availability for hydropower generation and cooling water usage for thermoelectric power. Improved understanding of how climate change may impact the availability and temperature of water resources is therefore of major importance. Here we use a multi-model ensemble to show the potential impacts of climate change on global hydropower and cooling water discharge potential. For the first time, combined projections of streamflow and water temperature were produced with three global hydrological models (GHMs) to account for uncertainties in the structure and parametrization of these GHMs in both water availability and water temperature. The GHMs were forced with bias-corrected output of five general circulation models (GCMs) for both the lowest and highest representative concentration pathways (RCP2.6 and RCP8.5). The ensemble projections of streamflow and water temperature were then used to quantify impacts on gross hydropower potential and cooling water discharge capacity of rivers worldwide. We show that global gross hydropower potential is expected to increase between +2.4\% (GCM-GHM ensemble mean for RCP 2.6) and +6.3\% (RCP 8.5) for the 2080s compared to 1971\textendash 2000. The strongest increases in hydropower potential are expected for Central Africa, India, central Asia and the northern high-latitudes, with 18\textendash 33\% of the world population living in these areas by the 2080s. Global mean cooling water discharge capacity is projected to decrease by 4.5-15\% (2080s). The largest reductions are found for the United States, Europe, eastern Asia, and southern parts of South America, Africa and Australia, where strong water temperature increases are projected combined with reductions in mean annual streamflow. These regions are expected to affect 11\textendash 14\% (for RCP2.6 and the shared socio-economic pathway (SSP)1, SSP2, SSP4) and 41\textendash 51\% (RCP8.5\textendash SSP3, SSP5) of the world population by the 2080s.}

  abstract = {Abstract                            Southeastern South America (SESA; encompassing Paraguay, Southern Brazil, Uruguay, and northern Argentina) experienced a 27\% increase in austral summer precipitation from 1902-2019, one of the largest observed trends in seasonal precipitation globally. Previous research identifies Atlantic Multidecadal Variability and anthropogenic forcing from stratospheric ozone depletion and greenhouse gas emissions as key factors contributing to the positive precipitation trends in SESA. We analyze multi-model ensemble simulations from Phases 5 and 6 of the Coupled Model Intercomparison Project (CMIP) and find that not only do Earth System Models simulate positive SESA precipitation trends that are much weaker over the historical interval, but some models persistently simulate negative SESA precipitation trends under historical forcings. Similarly, 16-member ensembles from two atmospheric models forced with observed historical sea surface temperatures never simulate precipitation trends that even reach the lower bound of the observed trend's range of uncertainty. Moreover, while future 21               st               -century projections from CMIP6 yield positive ensemble mean precipitation trends over SESA that grow with increasing greenhouse-gas emissions, the mean forced response never exceeds the observed historical trend. Pre-industrial control runs from CMIP6 indicate that some models do occasionally simulate centennial-scale trends in SESA that fall within the observational range, but most models do not. Results point to significant uncertainties in the attribution of anthropogenically forced influences on the observed increases in precipitation over SESA, while also suggesting that internal decadal-to-centennial variability of unknown origin and not present in state-of-the-art models may have also played a large role in generating the 20               th               -21               st               -century SESA precipitation trend.}

LOO and WAIC have various advantages over simpler estimates of predictive error such as AIC and DIC but are less used in practice because they involve additional computational steps. Here we lay out fast and stable computations for LOO and WAIC that can be performed using existing simulation draws. We introduce an efficient computation of LOO using Pareto-smoothed importance sampling (PSIS), a new procedure for regularizing importance weights. Although WAIC is asymptotically equal to LOO, we demonstrate that PSIS-LOO is more robust in the finite case with weak priors or influential observations. As a byproduct of our calculations, we also obtain approximate standard errors for estimated predictive errors and for comparison of predictive errors between two models. We implement the computations in an R package called loo and demonstrate using models fit with the Bayesian inference package Stan.}

Although soil moisture varies strongly across the landscape, current monitoring capabilities are limited to coarse-scale satellite retrievals and a few regional in-situ networks. Here, we introduce SMAP-HydroBlocks (SMAP-HB), a high-resolution satellite-based surface soil moisture dataset at an unprecedented 30-m resolution (2015\textendash 2019) across the conterminous United States. SMAP-HB was produced by using a scalable cluster-based merging scheme that combines high-resolution land surface modeling, radiative transfer modeling, machine learning, SMAP satellite microwave data, and in-situ observations. We evaluated the resulting dataset over 1,192 observational sites. SMAP-HB performed substantially better than the current state-of-the-art SMAP products, showing a median temporal correlation of 0.73\,{$\pm$}\,0.13 and a median Kling-Gupta Efficiency of 0.52\,{$\pm$}\,0.20. The largest benefit of SMAP-HB is, however, the high spatial detail and improved representation of the soil moisture spatial variability and spatial accuracy with respect to SMAP products. The SMAP-HB dataset is available via zenodoand at https://waterai.earth/smaphb.},

We illustrate this point by focusing on modeling studies that assess flood risks in New Orleans, Louisiana. Addressing the ethical and epistemic implications of model design choices can help clarify the scope of factors necessary to inform ethically sound and economically efficient decision-making.}

Our analysis employs a variety of modeling groups that incorporate low- and high-top level members, with the aim of assessing the possible effects of including a well-resolved stratosphere on the model's ability to reproduce long-term observed annual precipitation trends. Results demonstrate that only a few regions show statistically significant differences in precipitation trends between observations and models. Nevertheless, this pattern is mostly caused by the strong interannual variability of precipitation in most of the world regions. Thus, statistically significant model-observation differences on trends (1891\textendash 2014) are found at the zonal mean scale. The different model groups clearly fail to reproduce the spatial patterns of annual precipitation trends and the regions where stronger increases or decreases are recorded. This study also stresses that there are no significant differences between low- and high-top models in capturing observed precipitation trends, indicating that having a well-resolved stratosphere has a low impact on the accuracy of precipitation projections.}

In Venezuela, dengue has emerged as one of the most important public health problems of urban areas with frequent epidemics since 2001. The long-term pattern of this disease has involved not only a general upward trend in cases but also a dramatic increase in the size and frequency of epidemic outbreaks. By assuming that climate variability has a relevant influence on these changes in time, we quantified the periodicity of dengue incidence in time-series of data from two northern regions of Venezuela. Disease cycles of 1 and 3\textendash 4 years (p\,{$<$}\,0.05) were detected. We determined that dengue cycles corresponded with local climate and the El Ni\~no Southern Oscillation (ENSO) variation at both seasonal and inter-annual scales (every 2\textendash 3 years). Dengue incidence peaks were more prevalent during the warmer and dryer years of El Ni\~no confirming that ENSO is a regional climatic driver of such long-term periodicity through local changes in temperature and rainfall. Our findings support the evidence of the effect of climate on dengue dynamics and advocate the incorporation of climate information in the surveillance and prediction of this arboviral disease in Venezuela.},

  abstract = {A substantial literature over the past thirty years has evaluated tradeoffs between money and fatality risks. These values in turn serve as estimates of the value of a statistical life. This article reviews more than 60 studies of mortality risk premiums from ten countries and approximately 40 studies that present estimates of injury risk premiums. This critical review examines a variety of econometric issues, the role of unionization in risk premiums, and the effects of age on the value of a statistical life. Our meta-analysis indicates an income elasticity of the value of a statistical life from about 0.5 to 0.6. The paper also presents a detailed discussion of policy applications of these value of a statistical life estimates and related issues, including risk-risk analysis.}

Reducing the emissions of greenhouse gases into the atmosphere may mitigate the increasing risks somewhat, but the major task for regional and local stakeholders will be to prepare for appropriate adaptation. In most cases, possible strategies include intensification of coastal defense measures, in particular strengthening dykes, and adaptation to intermittent flooding. In case of Hamburg and the tidal Elbe river a third option seems to be available, which aims at mitigating storm surge risks by applying estuary engineering constructions. This option is sketched in this paper. The option has the potential to significantly reduce the expected future increases of local surge heights.}

  abstract = {The risk of pluvial flooding, heat stress and drought is increasing due to climate change. To increase urban resilience to extreme weather events, it is essential to combine green and blue infrastructure and link enhanced storage capacity in periods of water surplus with moments of water shortage as well as water availability with heat stress. `Blue-green measures' is a collective term for sustainable green and blue infrastructure that utilises underlying ecosystem functions to deliver multiple benefits: for example, cooling via evapotranspiration, water storage for heavy rainfall events, discharge peak attenuation, seasonal water storage, and groundwater recharge. Measures contribute most to climate adaptation when implemented in combinations. Such packages of blue-green measures capitalize upon the synergistic interactions between ecosystem functions and hence enhance multiple vulnerability reduction capacities. Moreover, combining blue-green measures enables using their unique potential at different spatial scales and establishing hydrologic connectivity. This paper proposes a framework for a planning support system and a tool to select adaptation measures to support urban planners in collaboratively finding site-specific sets of blue-green measures for a particular urban reconstruction project. With the proposed framework users can evaluate appropriateness of specific adaptation measures for a particular location and compose effective packages of blue-green measures to handle flooding, drought and heat stress. It is concluded that the framework: 1) enables incorporating knowledge on urban climate adaptation and ecosystem services in a communicative urban planning process, 2) guides the selection of a coherent and effective package of blue-green adaptation measures.}

  abstract = {Vegetated foreshores adjacent to engineered structures (so-called hybrid flood defenses), are considered to have high potential in reducing flood risk, even in the face of sea level rise and increasing storminess. However, foreshores such as salt marshes and mangrove forests are generally characterized by relatively strong temporal and spatial variations in geometry and vegetation characteristics (e.g., stem height and density), which causes uncertainties with regards to their protective value under extreme storm conditions. Currently, no method is available to assess the failure probability of a hybrid flood defense, taking into account the aforementioned uncertainties. This paper presents a method to determine the failure probability of a hybrid flood defense, integrating models and stochastic parameters that describe dike failure and wave propagation over a vegetated foreshore. Two dike failure mechanisms are considered: failure due to (i) wave overtopping and (ii) wave impact on revetments. Results show that vegetated foreshores cause a reduction in failure probability for both mechanisms. This effect is more pronounced for wave impact on revetments than for wave overtopping, since revetment failure occurs at relatively low water levels. The relevance of different uncertainties depends on the protection level and associated dike height and strength. For relatively low dikes (i.e., low protection levels), vegetation remains stable in design conditions, and plays an important role in reducing wave loads. In case of higher protection levels, hence for more robust dikes, vegetation is less important than foreshore geometry, because of expected stem breakage of the vegetation under these more extreme conditions. The integrated analysis of uncertainties in hydraulic loads, dike geometry and foreshore characteristics in this paper enables the comparison between nature-based flood defenses and traditionally engineered solutions, and allows coastal engineers to design hybrid flood defenses worldwide.}

Here we quantify, for the first time at global scale, the uncertainties in present-day ESL estimates, which have by default been ignored in broad-scale sea-level rise impact assessments to date. ESL uncertainties exceed those from global SLR projections and, assuming that we meet the Paris agreement goals, the projected SLR itself by the end of the century in many regions.

New peak loads would be highly heterogeneous (e.g., 4-fold increase in some states) with very low load factors (fewer than 100 full load hours annually). Without increasing peak loads, currently available electric heat pumps can reduce fossil fuels to 43\% of total heating energy supply (currently 70\%). Future advances in heat pump technology could reduce this further to 23\%; however, several challenging regions would remain. We show that installing heat pumps and retaining some fossil fuel equipment for use in only the coldest weather could reduce fossil fuels to 1\%\textendash 3\% of heating energy while progressively reducing fossil fuel heating capacity and avoiding electricity capacity upgrades. Therefore, strategic use of legacy infrastructure could facilitate a more flexible transition to low-carbon heating.}

We argue that a sustainable plan should not only achieve economic, environmental, and social objectives, but should be robust and able to be adapted over time to (unforeseen) future conditions. Large numbers of papers dealing with robustness and adaptive plans have begun to appear, but the literature is fragmented. The papers appear in disparate journals, and deal with a wide variety of policy domains. This paper (1) describes and compares a family of related conceptual approaches to designing a sustainable plan, and (2) describes several computational tools supporting these approaches. The conceptual approaches all have their roots in an approach to long-term planning called Assumption-Based Planning. Guiding principles for the design of a sustainable adaptive plan are: explore a wide variety of relevant uncertainties, connect short-term targets to long-term goals over time, commit to short-term actions while keeping options open, and continuously monitor the world and take actions if necessary. A key computational tool across the conceptual approaches is a fast, simple (policy analysis) model that is used to make large numbers of runs, in order to explore the full range of uncertainties and to identify situations in which the plan would fail.}

We find that basin-wide and paleohurricane compiled TC counts are significantly correlated with one another for the past millennium on annual to multi-decadal timescales, but compilation skill is limited by proxy temporal resolution. Current paleohurricane proxy networks predominantly capture storms moving in the Caribbean/Gulf of Mexico.

  abstract = {{$<$}p{$><$}strong class="journal-contentHeaderColor"{$>$}Abstract.{$<$}/strong{$>$} This study develops a neural-network-based approach for emulating high-resolution modeled precipitation data with comparable statistical properties but at greatly reduced computational cost. The key idea is to use combination of low- and high-resolution simulations (that differ not only in spatial resolution but also in geospatial patterns) to train a neural network to map from the former to the latter. Specifically, we define two types of CNNs, one that stacks variables directly and one that encodes each variable before stacking, and we train each CNN type both with a conventional loss function, such as mean square error (MSE), and with a conditional generative adversarial network (CGAN), for a total of four CNN variants. We compare the four new CNN-derived high-resolution precipitation results with precipitation generated from original high-resolution simulations, a bilinear interpolater and the state-of-the-art CNN-based super-resolution (SR) technique. Results show that the SR technique produces results similar to those of the bilinear interpolator with smoother spatial and temporal distributions and smaller data variabilities and extremes than the original high-resolution simulations. While the new CNNs trained by MSE generate better results over some regions than the interpolator and SR technique do, their predictions are still biased from the original high-resolution simulations. The CNNs trained by CGAN generate more realistic and physically reasonable results, better capturing not only data variability in time and space but also extremes such as intense and long-lasting storms. The new proposed CNN-based downscaling approach can downscale precipitation from 50 to 12 km in 14 min for 30 years once the network is trained (training takes 4 h using 1 GPU), while the conventional dynamical downscaling would take 1 month using 600 CPU cores to generate simulations at the resolution of 12 km over the contiguous United States.{$<$}/p{$>$}}

The main benefit of this factoring is to generalize learning across actions without imposing any change to the underlying reinforcement learning algorithm. Our results show that this architecture leads to better policy evaluation in the presence of many similar-valued actions.

However, the extent to which SLR affects flood hazards and human vulnerability to flooding in the built environment is not well understood. This study investigates the effects of future SLR on coastal flood hazards and human vulnerability to flooding in New York City's built environment. With a focus on a hurricane-induced flood event, we utilize a building-scale hydrodynamic model to simulate flood hazards under different 21st-century SLR scenarios. We further implement a human vulnerability model to reveal how the physical vulnerability of individuals to flooding would respond to the effects of SLR on flood hazards. We find that SLR would result in a substantial increase in not only the floodwater depth but also the floodwater velocity in the study area. For example, under a 1.04~m SLR scenario, the increase in the max floodwater speed exceeds 2.7~m/s (1271\%) in 5\% of the area that was flooded under the no-SLR scenario (control run). Model results show that, due to nonlinear interactions, the floodwater depth simulated by the hydrodynamic model for a SLR scenario could substantially differ from the depth estimated based on a linear addition of the SLR to the control-run floodwater depth. We find that the effects of SLR on flood hazards would, in turn, substantially affect the extent, intensity, and duration of human physical vulnerability to flooding, which could potentially increase the number of injuries and mortalities.}

Internationally, there are calls for more attention for multi-hazards and multi-risks. Within the European Union (EU), the concepts of multi-hazard and multi-risk assessment and management have taken centre stage in recent years. In this perspective paper, we outline several key developments in multi-(hazard-)risk research in the last decade, with a particular focus on the EU. We present challenges for multi-(hazard-)risk management as outlined in several research projects and papers. We then present a research agenda for addressing these challenges. We argue for an approach that addresses multi-(hazard-)risk management through the lens of sustainability challenges that cut across sectors, regions, and hazards. In this approach, the starting point is a specific sustainability challenge, rather than an individual hazard or sector, and trade-offs and synergies are examined across sectors, regions, and hazards. We argue for in-depth case studies in which various approaches for multi-(hazard-)risk management are co-developed and tested in practice. Finally, we present a new pan-European research project in which our proposed research agenda will be implemented, with the goal of enabling stakeholders to develop forward-looking disaster risk management pathways that assess trade-offs and synergies of various strategies across sectors, hazards, and spatial scales.{$<$}/p{$>$}}

  abstract = {Summary Floods are one of the most serious forms of natural hazards in terms of the damages they cause. In 2012 alone, flood damages exceeded 19 billion. A large proportion of the damages from several recent major flood disasters, such as those in South India and South Carolina (2015), England and Wales (2014), the Mississippi (2012), Thailand (2011), Queensland (Australia) (2010-2011), and Pakistan (2010), were related to the long duration of those flood events. However, most flood risk studies to date do not account for flood duration. In this paper, we provide the first global modelling exercise to assess the link between interannual climate variability and flood duration and frequency. Specifically, we examine relationships between simulated flood events and El Ni\~no Southern Oscillation (ENSO). Our results show that the duration of flooding appears to be more sensitive to ENSO than is the case for flood frequency. At the globally aggregated scale, we found floods to be significantly longer during both El Ni\~no and La Ni\~na years, compared to neutral years. At the scale of individual river basins, we found strong correlations between ENSO and both flood frequency and duration for a large number of basins, with generally stronger correlations for flood duration than for flood frequency. Future research on flood impacts should attempt to incorporate more information on flood durations.}

  abstract = {Renewable sources of electricity, such as solar and wind, need to be paired with sources of reliable baseload. Hydropower is a renewable, low-emission source of electricity baseload available throughout much of the world as an alternative to electricity conventionally provided by thermal combustion of fossil fuels; however, the global hydropower sector as it stands relies upon surface water flows of substantial and predictable volume. This makes it vulnerable to climate change. The impact of climate change on the hydropower sector is difficult to predict, and not globally uniform. It might be positive, negative, or inconsequential depending upon the local timing and magnitude of changes, reservoir size, allocation priority, and the energy market. The secondary effects of climate change on glacier lake outbursts floods, landslides, and sediment load are poorly understood. In addition, when planning hydropower projects for the future, attention must be given to the greenhouse gas contribution of the impounded waters behind storage dams, and the impact of dams on water temperature. In the past decade, sovereign nations and international development agencies worldwide have evaluated the potential of hydropower as a cost-effective, clean, sustainable option for baseload electricity supply. There is therefore a crucial need to assess the opportunities and risks hydropower poses across a wide range of potential future climate conditions. This review paper conducts a global survey of the literature on the effect of climate change on hydropower and identifies room for improvement in current approaches to evaluation of the net benefits of hydropower projects under climate change.

Investment in these systems has increased rapidly in Australia in the past 10 years, yet public and private investment in these systems can still be difficult, complex, costly and risky. An in depth case study analysis of Sydney, revealed that while the local policy, institutional and regulatory environment is on the surface conducive to the uptake of local recycled water, actual practice has surprisingly mitigated against further and broader investment in these systems. These instruments are often counteracted by multiple opposing levers that in some instances were developed for entirely different purposes. The generalizable insight is that a systematic, systemic, detailed review of these instruments and levers can reveal unexpected contradictions and provide a strong and defensible base from which to develop strategies to address unintended consequences and remove barriers to future investment.}

  abstract = {Decision making under deep uncertainty (DMDU) approaches are well-suited for making decisions about infrastructure to manage flooding exacerbated by climate change. One important system for climate resilience and flood management is green infrastructure, which refers to a network of natural and semi-engineered areas that provides ecosystem functions. Green infrastructure is often characterized as a low-regret strategy with multiple co-benefits under uncertainty. These attributes enable green infrastructure to be an important adaptation strategy under DMDU frameworks for flood management. However, DMDU analyses that include green infrastructure are still relatively limited, perhaps due to computational or modeling complexity and other barriers. This paper identifies and reviews publications in the flood management literature that use DMDU frameworks and refer to green infrastructure adaptation strategies, in order to identify trends and inform future research. The reviewed publications are categorized according to a variety of performance metrics, climate change scenarios, DMDU metrics, and hydrologic modelling techniques, and represent several adaptation strategies applied to case studies on five continents using a range of data sources and assumptions. This paper highlights a number of solutions that can be employed to facilitate additional research at the intersection of these fields. Primary among these is the transparent documentation and use of open source models, methods, and data. Future research should also focus on communication among different stakeholders, particularly in ensuring definitions, assumptions, and data requirements are clear. These partnerships can facilitate effective application of robust strategies such as green infrastructure for urban adaptation to the effects of climate change.}

This research responds to this through applying a cellular automata-based rapid scenario screening framework to predict the flood management performance of green infrastructure strategies across an urban catchment in Melbourne City Centre (Australia). Key findings indicate an intensive application of green infrastructure could substantially reduce flood depth and velocity in the catchment but that residual risk remains, particularly during extreme flood events. The best performing intervention strategy in the study area was found to be catchment-wide decentralised rainwater capture. The research also evidences the utility of rapid scenario screening tools to complement existing flood modelling approaches through screening management strategies, exploring scenarios and engaging a wide range of multi-disciplinary stakeholders.}

Scheduled sampling (forcing the model to gradually use its own past predictions rather than ground truth) is essential for avoiding amplification of early forecasting errors.

Engineering, for much of the twentieth century, was mainly about artifacts and inventions. Now, it's increasingly about complex systems. As the airplane taxis to the gate, you access the Internet and check email with your PDA, linking the communication and transportation systems. At home, you recharge your plug-in hybrid vehicle, linking transportation to the electricity grid. Today's large-scale, highly complex sociotechnical systems converge, interact, and depend on each other in ways engineers of old could barely have imagined. As scale, scope, and complexity increase, engineers consider technical and social issues together in a highly integrated way as they design flexible, adaptable, robust systems that can be easily modified and reconfigured to satisfy changing requirements and new technological opportunities. Engineering Systems offers a comprehensive examination of such systems and the associated emerging field of study. Through scholarly discussion, concrete examples, and history, the authors consider the engineer's changing role, new ways to model and analyze these systems, the impacts on engineering education, and the future challenges of meeting human needs through the technologically enabled systems of today and tomorrow.},

  abstract = {Occam's Razor is a bedrock principle of science philosophy, stating that the simplest hypothesis (or model) is preferred, at any given level of model predictive performance. A modern restatement often attributed to Einstein explains, ``Everything should be made as simple as possible, but not simpler.'' Using principles from (algorithmic) information theory, both model descriptive performance and model complexity can be quantified in bits. This quantification yields a Pareto-style trade-off between model complexity (length of the model program in bits) and model performance (information loss in bits, or the missing information, needed to describe the original observations). Model complexity and performance can be collapsed to one single measure of lossless model size, which, when minimized, leads to optimal model complexity versus loss trade-off for generalization and prediction. Our view puts both simple data-driven and complex physical-process-based models on a continuum, in the sense that both describe patterns in observed data in compressed form, with different degrees of generality, model complexity, and descriptive performance. Information theory-based assessment of compression performance with fair and meaningful accounting for model complexity will enable us to best compare and combine the strengths of physics knowledge and data-driven modeling for a given problem, given the availability of data. ``Suppose we draw a set of points on paper in a totally random manner'' \ldots{} ``I am saying it is possible to find a geometric line whose notation is constant and uniform, following a certain law, that will pass through all points, and in the same order they were drawn.'' ``But if that law is strongly composed, the thing that conforms to it should be seen as irregular''Gottfried Wilhelm Leibniz, 1686: Discours de m\'etaphysique V, VI (from French)},

This paper tackles a small, but important, component of data cleaning: data tidying. Tidy datasets are easy to manipulate, model and visualize, and have a specific structure: each variable is a column, each observation is a row, and each type of observational unit is a table. This framework makes it easy to tidy messy datasets because only a small set of tools are needed to deal with a wide range of un-tidy datasets. This structure also makes it easier to develop tidy tools for data analysis, tools that both input and output tidy datasets. The advantages of a consistent data structure and matching tools are demonstrated with a case study free from mundane data manipulation chores.}

Most textbooks, for example, ignore the ethical differences between Pareto efficiency (based on voluntary win-win outcomes) and the modern Kaldor-Hicks efficiency used in public policy assessments (in which winners gain more than losers lose). For the latter to be ethically palatable, society must have in place basic institutions of justice, transparency, and accountability. Normative economics thus requires a pluralist approach that includes considerations of virtue and duty, closer to Adam Smith's Enlightenment conceptions. This surprising finding should embolden economics teachers to engage students with critical thinking problems that are controversial and relevant, and which better prepare students for a complex world.}

  abstract = {Spatio-temporal data are ubiquitous in the agricultural, ecological, and environmental sciences, and their study is important for understanding and predicting a wide variety of processes. One of the difficulties with modeling spatial processes that change in time is the complexity of the dependence structures that must describe how such a process varies, and the presence of high-dimensional complex data sets and large prediction domains. It is particularly challenging to specify parameterizations for nonlinear dynamic spatio-temporal models (DSTMs) that are simultaneously useful scientifically and efficient computationally. Statisticians have developed deep hierarchical models that can accommodate process complexity as well as the uncertainties in the predictions and inference. However, these models can be expensive and are typically application specific. On the other hand, the machine learning community has developed alternative "deep learning" approaches for nonlinear spatio-temporal modeling. These models are flexible yet are typically not implemented in a probabilistic framework. The two paradigms have many things in common and suggest hybrid approaches that can benefit from elements of each framework. This overview paper presents a brief introduction to the deep hierarchical DSTM (DH-DSTM) framework, and deep models in machine learning, culminating with the deep neural DSTM (DN-DSTM). Recent approaches that combine elements from DH-DSTMs and echo state network DN-DSTMs are presented as illustrations.},

Less certain is the extent to which meteorological processes at individual sites will be affected. So-called `downscaling' techniques are used to bridge the spatial and temporal resolution gaps between what climate modellers are currently able to provide and what impact assessors require. This paper describes a decision support tool for assessing local climate change impacts using a robust statistical downscaling technique. Statistical DownScaling Model (sdsm) facilitates the rapid development of multiple, low-cost, single-site scenarios of daily surface weather variables under current and future regional climate forcing. Additionally, the software performs ancillary tasks of predictor variable pre-screening, model calibration, basic diagnostic testing, statistical analyses and graphing of climate data. The application of sdsm is demonstrated with respect to the generation of daily temperature and precipitation scenarios for Toronto, Canada by 2040\textendash 2069.}

We analyzed the infrastructure and technology path required to meet California's goal of an 80\% reduction below 1990 levels, using detailed modeling of infrastructure stocks, resource constraints, and electricity system operability. We found that technically feasible levels of energy efficiency and decarbonized energy supply alone are not sufficient; widespread electrification of transportation and other sectors is required. Decarbonized electricity would become the dominant form of energy supply, posing challenges and opportunities for economic growth and climate policy. This transformation demands technologies that are not yet commercialized, as well as coordination of investment, technology development, and infrastructure deployment. Reducing greenhouse gas emissions to 80\% below 1990 levels by 2050 requires widespread electrification of transportation and other sectors.

  abstract = {The Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) Special Report on Global Warming of 1.5\textdegree C points to the need for carbon neutrality by mid-century. Achieving this in the United States in only 30 years will be challenging, and practical pathways detailing the technologies, infrastructure, costs, and tradeoffs involved are needed. Modeling the entire U.S. energy and industrial system with new analysis tools that capture synergies not represented in sector-specific or integrated assessment models, we created multiple pathways to net zero and net negative CO2 emissions by 2050. They met all forecast U.S. energy needs at a net cost of 0.2\textendash 1.2\% of GDP in 2050, using only commercial or near-commercial technologies, and requiring no early retirement of existing infrastructure. Pathways with constraints on consumer behavior, land use, biomass use, and technology choices (e.g., no nuclear) met the target but at higher cost. All pathways employed four basic strategies: energy efficiency, decarbonized electricity, electrification, and carbon capture. Least-cost pathways were based on {$>$}80\% wind and solar electricity plus thermal generation for reliability. A 100\% renewable primary energy system was feasible but had higher cost and land use. We found multiple feasible options for supplying low-carbon fuels for non-electrifiable end uses in industry, freight, and aviation, which were not required in bulk until after 2035. In the next decade, the actions required in all pathways were similar: expand renewable capacity 3.5 fold, retire coal, maintain existing gas generating capacity, and increase electric vehicle and heat pump sales to {$>$}50\% of market share. This study provides a playbook for carbon neutrality policy with concrete near-term priorities.},

We present a simple sea surface temperature (SST)-based index of this longitude that compactly characterizes the different spatial patterns, or flavors of observed and projected ENSO events. It recovers the familiar global responses of temperature, precipitation, and tropical cyclones to ENSO and identifies historical extreme El Ni\~no events. Despite its simplicity, the new longitude index describes the nonlinear relationship between the first two principal components of SST, and unlike previous indices, accounts for background SST changes associated with the seasonal cycle and climate change. The index reveals that extreme El Ni\~no, El Ni\~no Modoki, and La Ni\~na events are projected to become more frequent in the future at the expense of neutral ENSO conditions.},

  abstract = {In a previous study, Foufoula-Georgiou (1989a) investigated a stochastic storm transposition (SST) approach as a possible methodology of assessing the probability of exceedance of extreme precipitation depths over a catchment. The purpose of this paper is to report further methodological advances on the SST approach and present the results of a pilot implementation study in the Midwest. Under the assumptions of an elliptical storm shape and spread function of a given functional form, extreme storms have been described by the joint probability distribution of seven storm parameters (five specifying the magnitude, orientation, shape, and within-storm spatial variability, and two specifying the location of the storm center). A nonhomogeneous spatial multivariate point process model has been postulated for the joint probability distribution of the storm center depth and storm location and it has been fitted to 65 extreme storms in the nine-state mid-western region. The method has been used to estimate the tails of the probability distribution of the average catchment depths over several hypothetical catchments in the Midwest and to describe the spatial variability of the estimates over the studied region.},

  abstract = {Computers are now essential in all branches of science, but most researchers are never taught the equivalent of basic lab skills for research computing. As a result, data can get lost, analyses can take much longer than necessary, and researchers are limited in how effectively they can work with software and data. Computing workflows need to follow the same practices as lab projects and notebooks, with organized data, documented steps, and the project structured for reproducibility, but researchers new to computing often don't know where to start. This paper presents a set of good computing practices that every researcher can adopt, regardless of their current level of computational skill. These practices, which encompass data management, programming, collaborating with colleagues, organizing projects, tracking work, and writing manuscripts, are drawn from a wide variety of published sources from our daily lives and from our work with volunteer organizations that have delivered workshops to over 11,000 people since 2010.}

In this paper, we use a new 30 m resolution model of the entire conterminous US with a 2D representation of flood physics to produce estimates of flood hazard, which match to within 90\% accuracy the skill of local models built with detailed data. These flood depths are combined with exposure datasets of commensurate resolution to calculate current and future flood risk. Our data show that the total US population exposed to serious flooding is 2.6\textendash 3.1 times higher than previous estimates, and that nearly 41 million Americans live within the 1\% annual exceedance probability floodplain (compared to only 13 million when calculated using FEMA flood maps). We find that population and GDP growth alone are expected to lead to significant future increases in exposure, and this change may be exacerbated in the future by climate change.}

Observed flood losses are not monotonic functions of depth, but instead better follow a beta function, with bimodal distributions for different water depths.

  abstract = {A decision-analytic approach to the problem of assessing the value of climate information is presented and an application of this methodology to a decision-making problem involving the use of climate information is described. First, decision analysis is discussed briefly with emphasis on its informational aspects. Then a decision-making situation is considered in which a farmer must decide which of two crops to plant in the face of uncertainty as to whether growing season precipitation will be above or below average. It is assumed that information concerning growing season precipitation is embodied in a climate forecast provided by a meteorologist and that this information constitutes the basis for the farmer's decision. Several probabilistic models for the climate forecasts are considered, including symmetric and asymmetric discrete distributions and a normal model. These models can provide reasonable descriptions of currently available climate forecasts. The analysis reveals that relatively uncertain climate information may be of value in some decision-making situations, although the value of climate forecasts with skill levels commensurate with existing seasonal forecasts does not approach the value of perfect forecasts. Nevertheless, in the situations considered, once a minimum level of skill is achieved, further improvements in the forecasts result in steadily increasing benefits. Finally, it is indicated that decision analysis is also applicable to more complex situations in which climate information may play an important role.},

  abstract = {The need to adapt to climate change is now widely recognised as evidence of its impacts on social and natural systems grows and greenhouse gas emissions continue unabated. Yet efforts to adapt to climate change, as reported in the literature over the last decade and in selected case studies, have not led to substantial rates of implementation of adaptation actions despite substantial investments in adaptation science. Moreover, implemented actions have been mostly incremental and focused on proximate causes; there are far fewer reports of more systemic or transformative actions. We found that the nature and effectiveness of responses was strongly influenced by framing. Recent decision-oriented approaches that aim to overcome this situation are framed within a ``pathways'' metaphor to emphasise the need for robust decision making within adaptive processes in the face of uncertainty and inter-temporal complexity. However, to date, such ``adaptation pathways'' approaches have mostly focused on contexts with clearly identified decision-makers and unambiguous goals; as a result, they generally assume prevailing governance regimes are conducive for adaptation and hence constrain responses to proximate causes of vulnerability. In this paper, we explore a broader conceptualisation of ``adaptation pathways'' that draws on `pathways thinking' in the sustainable development domain to consider the implications of path dependency, interactions between adaptation plans, vested interests and global change, and situations where values, interests, or institutions constrain societal responses to change. This re-conceptualisation of adaptation pathways aims to inform decision makers about integrating incremental actions on proximate causes with the transformative aspects of societal change. Case studies illustrate what this might entail. The paper ends with a call for further exploration of theory, methods and procedures to operationalise this broader conceptualisation of adaptation.}

  abstract = {Floodplains perform diverse functions, including attenuation of fluxes of water, solutes, and particulate material. Critical details of floodplain storage including magnitude, duration, and spatial distribution are strongly influenced by floodplain biogeochemical processes and biotic communities. Floodplain storage of diverse materials can be conceptualized in the form of a budget that quantifies inputs, outputs, and storage within the floodplain control volume. The floodplain control volume is here defined as bounded on the inner edges by the banks of the active channel(s), on the outer edges by the limit of periodic flooding and the deposition of fluvially transported sediment, on the underside by the extent of hyporheic exchange flows and the floodplain aquifer, and on the upper side by the upper elevation of living vegetation. Fluxes within the floodplain control volume can also change the location, characteristics, and residence time of material in storage. Fluxes, residence time, and quantities of material stored in floodplains can be measured directly; inferred from diverse types of remotely sensed data; or quantitatively estimated using numerical models. Human activities can modify floodplain storage by: hydrologically and/or geomorphically disconnecting channels and floodplains; altering fluxes of water and sediment to the river corridor; and obliterating floodplains through alluvial mining or urbanization. Floodplain restoration can focus on enlarging the functional floodplain, reconnecting the channel and floodplain, restoring natural regimes of water, sediment, and/or large wood, or enhancing the spatial heterogeneity of the channel and floodplain. Each form of floodplain restoration can increase floodplain storage and resilience to disturbances.},

  abstract = {Wind energy is an important pillar of decarbonization strategies and potentially vulnerable to climate change. Existing wind climate change assessments rely on climate models but a systematic investigation of the global-to-regional climate modeling chain is missing. In this study, I highlight key limitations, namely (a) the differing representation of land use change in global and regional climate models which compromises comparability, and (b) the consistency of large-scale features along the global-to-regional climate modeling chain. To this end, I analyze the large European Coordinated Downscaling Experiment (EURO-CORDEX) ensemble (rcp85: N = 49; rcp45: N= 18; rcp26: N = 22) along with the driving global models (rcp85: N = 7; rcp45: N = 5; rcp26: N = 7), finding evidence that climate change reduces mean wind speeds by up to -0.8 m s-1 (offshore) and -0.3 m s-1 (onshore). I provide physical explanations for these changes by identifying two key drivers. First, onshore wind speeds drop in the driving global models in regions and scenarios with strong land use change but show no drop in EURO-CORDEX where land use is held constant. Second, offshore wind reductions follow decreases in the equator-to-pole temperature gradient remarkably well with correlations reaching around 0.9 in resource-rich European countries like Ireland, the United Kingdom and Norway, implying that arctic amplification is a severe risk for European offshore wind energy. My results suggest that earlier conclusions of negligible climate change impacts on wind energy might be premature if either land use changes strongly or polar amplification is at or above the range sampled in global climate models. \textcopyright{} 2022 The Author(s).

The observed systematic wind speed decline up to around 2010 (stilling) and its subsequent recovery have therefore attracted much attention. While this sequence of downward and upwards trends and good connections to well-established modes of climate variability suggest that stilling could be a manifestation of multidecadal climate variability, a systematic investigation is currently lacking. Here, we use the Max Planck Institute Grand Ensemble (MPI-GE) to decompose internal variability from forced changes in wind speeds. We report that wind speed changes resembling observed stilling and its recovery are well in line with internal climate variability, both under current and future climate conditions. Moreover, internal climate variability outweighs forced changes in wind speeds on 20-year timescales by 1 order of magnitude, despite the fact that smaller, forced changes become relevant in the long run as they represent alterations of mean states. In this regard, we reveal that land use change plays a pivotal role in explaining MPI-GE ensemble-mean wind changes in the representative concentration pathways 2.6, 4.5, and 8.5. Our results demonstrate that multidecadal wind speed variability is of greater relevance than forced changes over the 21st century, in particular for wind-related infrastructure like wind energy. \textcopyright{} 2021 Copernicus GmbH.

One of the major uncertainties is the possible rapid disintegration of large fractions of the Antarctic ice sheet in response to rising global temperatures. This could potentially lead to several meters of sea-level rise during the next few centuries. Previous studies have typically been silent on two coupled questions: (i) What are probabilistic estimates of this ``fast dynamic'' contribution to sea-level rise? (ii) What are the implications for strategies to manage coastal flooding risks? Here, we present probabilistic hindcasts and projections of sea-level rise to 2100. The fast dynamic mechanism is approximated by a simple parameterization, designed to allow for a careful quantification of the uncertainty in its contribution to sea-level rise. We estimate that global temperature increases ranging from 1.9 to 3.1~\textdegree C coincide with fast Antarctic disintegration, and these contributions account for sea-level rise of 21\textendash 74~cm this century (5\textendash 95\% range, Representative Concentration Pathway 8.5). We use a simple cost-benefit analysis of coastal defense to demonstrate in a didactic exercise how neglecting this mechanism and associated uncertainty can (i) lead to strategies which fall sizably short of protection targets and (ii) increase the expected net costs.}

  abstract = {{$<$}p{$><$}strong{$>$}Abstract.{$<$}/strong{$>$} Simple models can play pivotal roles in the quantification and framing of uncertainties surrounding climate change and sea-level rise. They are computationally efficient, transparent, and easy to reproduce. These qualities also make simple models useful for the characterization of risk. Simple model codes are increasingly distributed as open source, as well as actively shared and guided. Alas, computer codes used in the geosciences can often be hard to access, run, modify (e.g., with regards to assumptions and model components), and review. Here, we describe the simple model framework BRICK (Building blocks for Relevant Ice and Climate Knowledge) v0.2 and its underlying design principles. The paper adds detail to an earlier published model setup and discusses the inclusion of a land water storage component. The framework largely builds on existing models and allows for projections of global mean temperature as well as regional sea levels and coastal flood risk. BRICK is written in R and Fortran. BRICK gives special attention to the model values of transparency, accessibility, and flexibility in order to mitigate the above-mentioned issues while maintaining a high degree of computational efficiency. We demonstrate the flexibility of this framework through simple model intercomparison experiments. Furthermore, we demonstrate that BRICK is suitable for risk assessment applications by using a didactic example in local flood risk management.{$<$}/p{$>$}}

  abstract = {This thesis develops a framework for a flexible design approach to support decision-making in water supply infrastructure planning. It contrasts with a conventional, deterministic planning approach that uses past data or forecasts to anticipate future needs. This thesis surveys current approaches that attempt to consider uncertainty, including scenario planning, decision analysis, sensitivity analysis, real options, dynamic strategic planning, and adaptive management. A flexible design approach builds on current approaches and explores flexibility through infrastructure size and function. The approach intends to be applicable across various water infrastructure systems. This thesis describes real world and theoretical applications of flexible design, including climate change adaptation planning for water utilities, flexible planning for water infrastructure investments, and flexibility in urban drainage systems. The proposed flexible design approach employs probabilistic and simulation methods to anticipate a range of future circumstances and identify top-performing strategies. The engine of the framework is a time-series stochastic analysis that uses simulation in a discounted cash flow Excel model. First, it identifies key inputs and performance metrics, characterizes uncertainty distributions, and defines strategies of varying flexibility. Next, it employs Monte Carlo simulation and compares strategy performance through target curves and multiple criteria analyses. Singapore's water resources system inspires the characteristics of the model. The best-performing flexible approach introduces a cost savings of 15\% over a 50-year timespan. To successfully implement a flexible design approach, leaders in the profession must guide the shift to planning methods that explicitly recognize the role of uncertainty in the planning process. While some implementation barriers present difficulties, the proposed flexible design approach enables substantial cost savings and fosters a deeper understanding of a water resources system in the face of future uncertainty.},

  abstract = {Coastal flooding drives considerable risks to many communities, but projections of future flood risks are deeply uncertain. The paucity of observations of extreme events often motivates the use of statistical approaches to model the distribution of extreme storm surge events. One key deep uncertainty that is often overlooked is model structural uncertainty. There is currently no strong consensus among experts regarding which class of statistical model to use as a `best practice'. Robust management of coastal flooding risks requires coastal managers to consider the distinct possibility of non-stationarity in storm surges. This increases the complexity of the potential models to use, which tends to increase the data required to constrain the model. Here, we use a Bayesian model averaging approach to analyze the balance between (i) model complexity sufficient to capture decision-relevant risks and (ii) data availability to constrain complex model structures. We characterize deep model structural uncertainty through a set of calibration experiments. Specifically, we calibrate a set of models ranging in complexity using long-term tide gauge observations from the Netherlands and the United States. We find that in both considered cases, roughly half of the model weight is associated with the non-stationary models. Our approach provides a formal framework to integrate information across model structures, in light of the potentially sizable modeling uncertainties. By combining information from multiple models, our inference sharpens for the projected storm surge 100 year return levels, and estimated return levels increase by several centimeters. We assess the impacts of data availability through a set of experiments with temporal subsets and model comparison metrics. Our analysis suggests that about 70 years of data are required to stabilize estimates of the 100 year return level, for the locations and methods considered here.}

  abstract = {Projections of coastal storm surge hazard are a basic requirement for effective management of coastal risks. A common approach for estimating hazards posed by extreme sea levels is to use a statistical model, which may use a time series of a climate variable as a covariate to modulate the statistical model and account for potentially nonstationary storm surge behavior (e.g., North Atlantic Oscillation index). Previous works using nonstationary statistical approaches to assess coastal flood hazard have demonstrated the importance of accounting for many key modeling uncertainties. However, many assessments have typically relied on a single climate covariate, which may leave out important processes and lead to potential biases in the projected flood hazards. Here, I employ a recently developed approach to integrate stationary and nonstationary statistical models, and characterize the effects of choice of covariate time series on projected flood hazard. Furthermore, I expand upon this approach by developing a nonstationary storm surge statistical model that makes use of multiple covariate time series, namely, global mean temperature, sea level, the North Atlantic Oscillation index and time. Using Norfolk, Virginia, as a case study, I show that a storm surge model that accounts for additional processes raises the projected 100-year storm surge return level by up to 23\&thinsp;cm relative to a stationary model or one that employs a single covariate time series. I find that the total model posterior probability associated with each candidate covariate, as well as a stationary model, is about 20\&thinsp;\%. These results shed light on how including a wider range of physical process information and considering nonstationary behavior can better enable modeling efforts to inform coastal risk management.}

Unfortunately, cost\textendash benefit analyses that assess SLR risks often fail to capture important political and social feedbacks. For example, adaptation measures (e.g., beach nourishment) can trigger greater development, undermining the value of adaptation infrastructure, incentivizing development, and increasing risks. We integrate diverse literature and data to develop a hypothesis and system dynamics model of coastal community responses to SLR. We apply the model to two U.S. communities, showing how political influence drives trajectories of infrastructure provision, cost, and vulnerability. We find that delayed feedbacks between perceived SLR risk and infrastructure investments mediate relationships between political capital, migration, and economic development. Community wealth and political influence may only delay the overshoot and collapse of its population and economy, as the ``virtuous cycles'' linking growth with infrastructure investment give way to ``vicious cycles'' of mounting infrastructure costs, political resistance to additional investment, and greater vulnerability.

  abstract = {Effective flood risk management involves the quantification of flood risk and the implementation of cost-effective, sustainable, and environmentally and socially acceptable measures that reduce flood risk. However, making decisions on the most appropriate long-term intervention investments can be challenging; this is primarily because of the uncertainties associated with future climate change and socioeconomic development. Real Options analysis is a widely recognised approach for encouraging appropriate climate change adaptation and mitigation investment decisions. To date, however, there has only been limited use of Real Options Analysis Techniques within the Flood and Coastal Erosion Risk Management community. In this paper, a methodology is described that has the capability to assess the most appropriate set of interventions to make in a flood system, given the future uncertainties. The methodology captures the concepts of Real Options and has the capability to value the flexibility associated with potential flood risk management intervention options across a range of future climate change and socioeconomic scenarios. The novel Real Options approach has been tested and verified on a real-life case study situated in the Thamesmead area of the Thames Estuary. The results obtained demonstrate the potential for substantial cost savings under future uncertainties when Real Options are used instead of more traditional, precautionary approaches.}

  abstract = {Flooding is the product of complex interactions among spatially and temporally varying rainfall, heterogeneous land surface properties, and drainage network structure. Conventional approaches to flood frequency analysis rely on assumptions regarding these interactions across a range of scales. The impacts of these assumptions on flood risk estimates are poorly understood. In this study, we present an alternative flood frequency analysis framework based on stochastic storm transposition (SST). We use SST to synthesize long records of rainfall over the Charlotte, North Carolina, USA metropolitan area by ``reshuffling'' radar rainfall fields, within a probabilistic framework, from a 10 year (2001\textendash 2010) high-resolution (15 min, 1 km2) radar data set. We use these resampled fields to drive a physics-based distributed hydrologic model for a heavily urbanized watershed in Charlotte. The approach makes it possible to estimate discharge return periods for all points along the drainage network without the assumptions regarding rainfall structure and its interactions with watershed features that are required using conventional methods. We develop discharge estimates for return periods from 10 to 1000 years for a range of watershed scales up to 110 km2. SST reveals that flood risk in the larger subwatersheds is dominated by tropical storms, while organized thunderstorm systems dominate flood risk in the smaller subwatersheds. We contrast these analyses with examples of potential problems that can arise from conventional frequency analysis approaches. SST provides an approach for examining the spatial extent of flooding and for incorporating nonstationarities in rainfall or land use into flood risk estimates.}

This paper compares pathways to meet desired emissions reduction goals with or without specified zero-carbon electricity targets. We show that when an additional lever for reducing emissions \textendash{} electrification of buildings and transportation \textendash{} is considered, New York State can meet the same desired emissions targets at considerably lower levelized costs of electricity (LCOEs) if specified zero-carbon electricity targets are relaxed. We also investigate how electrification induced new peak loads and limits on new gas infrastructure impact state decarbonization pathways. To meet the 40\% emissions reduction target by 2030, two new illustrative approaches are considered. One pathway with 100\% electrification of buildings and vehicles, 11~GW of wind and utility-scale solar capacity and 21~GW of new gas generation capacity leads to an LCOE of \$63/MWh. An alternate pathway that precludes new gas generation capacity requires 60\% electrification, nearly doubles the installed wind and solar capacity, and results in an LCOE of \$72/MWh. Due to the added emissions reduction benefits from electrification, both illustrative pathways are lower cost than a pathway in which the same 40\% reduction target is combined with a specified 70\% renewable target - at an LCOE of \$92/MWh. We also show that LCOEs can be kept manageable through shaving of new higher peak loads that arise from electrified heating. Moreover, the LCOE impact of limiting peak natural gas flow to its current quantities is found to be small.}

In this paper, we collaboratively release an open-source large-scale baseline model that is synthetic but nevertheless provides a realistic representation of the actual energy grid, accompanied by open-source cross-domain data sets. Leveraging the synthetic grid model, we reproduce the blackout event and critically assess several corrective measures that could have mitigated the blackout under such extreme weather conditions. We uncover the regional disparity of load shedding. The analysis also quantifies the sensitivity of several corrective measures with respect to mitigating the power outage, as measured in energy not served (ENS).

The analysis employs a unique integration of models and approaches, which are portable and applicable in diverse contexts and include: a nonparametric bootstrapping model for synthetically generating multiple realizations of regional rainfall, water supply and demand, and storage size and reliability outcomes; and an approach for determining expected water and energy savings and costs associated with the RWH system. Findings suggest that a RWH system designed to meet the outdoor irrigation demands of detached homes in Florida's Broward and Palm Beach Counties could meet 54\% of the total additional water demand created by the growing population in this region. This is significantly greater than the percentages of demand that could be met by several proposed centralized approaches to water supply using groundwater recharge by reclaimed water, comparable to the percentage of demand that could be met by desalinating brackish water from the Floridian Aquifer, but less than the percentage of demand that could be met by a proposed new reservoir and canal system for groundwater recharge. The findings also suggest that the expected cost of water provided by the decentralized RWH system, which includes substantial savings in energy requirements and costs, would be significantly less than the expected costs of water provided by all centralized water supply system alternatives considered, with the exception of the reservoir and canal system.}

In 2004\textendash 2005, we collected interview data from a random sample of 72 household heads in Villa Israel, a squatter settlement of Cochabamba, Bolivia. We examined the extent to which water-related emotional distress is linked with three dimensions of water insecurity: inadequate water supply; insufficient access to water distribution systems; and dependence on seasonal water sources, and with gender. We found that access to water distribution systems and female gender were significantly associated with emotional distress, while water supply and dependence on seasonal water sources were not. Economic assets, social assets, entitlements to water markets, and entitlements to reciprocal exchanges of water were significantly associated with emotional distress, while entitlements to a common-pool water resource institution were not. These results suggest that water-related emotional distress develops as a byproduct of the social and economic negotiations people employ to gain access to water distribution systems in the absence of clear procedures or established water rights rather than as a result of water scarcity per se. \'O 2008 Elsevier Ltd.

  abstract = {Centralized water infrastructure has, over the last century, brought safe and reliable drinking water to much of the world. But climate change, combined with aging and underfunding, is increasingly testing the limits of\textemdash and reversing gains made by\textemdash these large-scale water systems. To address these growing strains and gaps, we must assess and advance alternatives to centralized water provision. The water literature is rife with examples of systems that are neither centralized nor networked, but still meet water needs of local communities in important ways, including: informal and hybrid water systems, decentralized water provision, community-based water management, small drinking water systems, green infrastructures for water and wastewater management, point-of-use filtration, small-scale water vendors, and packaged water. Our work builds on these literatures by proposing a convergence approach that can integrate and explore the benefits and challenges of modular, adaptive, and decentralized (``MAD'') water provision, often foregrounding important advances in engineering technology. We further provide frameworks to evaluate justice, economic feasibility, good governance, human health, and environmental sustainability as key parameters of MAD water system performance.}

  abstract = {Household water insecurity has serious implications for the health, livelihoods and wellbeing of people around the world. Existing methods to assess the state of household water insecurity focus largely on water quality, quantity or adequacy, source or reliability, and affordability. These methods have significant advantages in terms of their simplicity and comparability, but are widely recognized to oversimplify and underestimate the global burden of household water insecurity. In contrast, a broader definition of household water insecurity should include entitlements and human capabilities, socio-cultural dynamics, and political institutions and processes. This paper proposes a mix of qualitative and quantitative methods that can be widely adopted across cultural, geographic, and demographic contexts to assess hard-to-measure dimensions of household water insecurity. In doing so, it critically evaluates existing methods for assessing household water insecurity and suggests ways in which methodological innovations advance a broader definition of household water insecurity.}

  abstract = {FEMA recommends that houses in coastal flood zones be elevated to at least 1 foot above the base flood elevation (BFE). However, this guideline is not specific and ignores characteristics of houses that affect their vulnerability. An economically optimal elevation level (OEL) is proposed that minimizes the combined cost of elevation and cumulative insurance premiums over the lifespan of the house. As an illustration, analysis is performed for various coastal houses in Ortley Beach, NJ. Compared with the strategy of raising houses to 1 foot above BFE, the strategy of raising houses to their OELs is much more economical for the homeowners. Elevating to the OELs also significantly reduces government spending on subsidizing low-income homeowners through, for example, a voucher program, to mitigate flood risk. These results suggest that policy makers should consider vulnerability factors in developing risk-reduction strategies. FEMA may recommend OELs to homeowners based on their flood hazards as well as house characteristics or at least providing more information and tools to homeowners to assist them in making more economical decisions. The OEL strategy can also be coupled with a voucher program to make the program more cost-effective.}

In this study, the performance and cost-effectiveness of six green infrastructure practices, namely, green roofs, rain gardens, pervious surfaces, swales, detention basins, and constructed wetlands, were investigated. The comprehensive performance evaluation in terms of the engineering performance, environmental impact, and economic cost was determined in the proposed engineering\textendash environmental\textendash economic (3E) triangle model. The results revealed that these green infrastructure practices were effective for stormwater management in terms of runoff attenuation, peak flow reduction and delay, and pollutant attenuation. It was suggested that for pollution control, detention basins can efficiently reduce the total suspended solids, total nitrogen, total phosphorus, and lead. The implementation of detention basins is highly recommended due to their higher engineering performance and lower environmental impact and economic cost. A case study of a preliminary cost\textendash benefit analysis of green infrastructure practice exemplified by the Pearl River Delta in China was addressed. It suggested that green infrastructure was cost-effective in stormwater management in this area, which would be helpful for sustaining healthy urban watersheds.},

  abstract = {Use of real time control (RTC) technology in rainwater harvesting systems can improve performance across water supply, flood protection, and environmental flow provision. Such systems make the most of rainfall forecast information, to release water prior to storm events and thus minimize uncontrolled overflows. To date, most advanced applications have adopted 24-hr forecast information, leaving longer-term forecasts largely untested. In this study, we aimed to predict the performance of four different RTC strategies, based on different forecast lead time and preferred objectives. RTC systems were predicted to yield comparatively less harvested rainwater than conventional passive systems but delivered superior performance in terms of flood mitigation and delivery of environmental water for streamflow restoration. More importantly, using a 7-day rainfall forecast was shown to enhance the ability of RTC in mitigating flood risks and delivering an outflow regime that is close to the natural (reference) streamflow. Such a finding suggests that RTC combined with 7-day forecast can enhance the functionality of rainwater harvesting systems to restore and even mimic the entire natural flow regimes in receiving streams. This also opens up a new opportunity for practitioners to implement smart technology in managing urban stormwater in a range of contexts and for a range of stream health objectives.},

Field observations at severe natural environment and laboratory tests under defined conditions were parallelly carried out in order to clarify wet snow accretion process under various conditions. In field observations, it was confirmed that snow easily accreted on insulators at temperature range especially between 0 and +1.0\textdegree C. The long-rod insulator's sheds were bridged more easily than that of cap \& pin type because of its narrower shed spacing. In laboratory tests, cylindrical snow accretion, which was found in the snowstorm in 2005, was achieved. The mechanisms on explaining snow accretion on long-rod insulators were found to be similar to those confirmed for wires. The laboratory simulations agree well with the field observations. In order to estimate the amount of snow flux on insulators caused by a snow event for given climatic conditions, an index called the snow accretion potential ability (SAP) was proposed. SAP is defined by using the snow flux and associated with the weight term in the index for the snow stress product (SSP). SAP was adopted to evaluate snow accretion characteristics by field observations and laboratory tests, and the snow accretion phenomenon during a snowstorm in 2005 was discussed.}

  abstract = {Rapid prediction of spatially distributed hydrological variables, such as water depths in rivers, is an important but challenging task. This study proposes a novel matrix-based deep learning approach for predicting spatial distribution of water depths in rivers. The proposed approach was constructed based on a two-dimensional (2D) convolutional neural network (CNN) with a new architecture that was specifically designed for providing spatial distribution maps. A numerical dataset was established based on a field cruise and two-dimensional hydraulic modeling for different scenarios, and numerical experiments were designed to predict spatial distribution of water depths for different scenarios using the adaptive neuro-fuzzy inference system (ANFIS), support vector machine (SVM), genetic programming (GP), multi-gene genetic programming (MGGP), one-dimensional CNN (1D-CNN), and the proposed CNN algorithms. The results showed that the proposed CNN approach captured both the large-scale and small-scale spatial patterns remarkably well, and it outperformed the other approaches. This study shows that the 2D CNN algorithm is better than the classical machine learning (ML) algorithms for inundation modeling. The proposed approach is thus a promising tool for providing rapid predictions of spatial distribution of water depths in river systems and can potentially be leveraged to predict other spatially distributed hydrological variables.}

The standard infrastructure design approach relies on local precipitation-based intensity-duration-frequency (PREC-IDF) curves that do not account for snow process and assume stationary climate, leading to high failure risk and increased maintenance costs. This paper reviews the recently developed next-generation IDF (NG-IDF) curves that explicitly account for the mechanisms of extreme water available for runoff including rainfall, snowmelt, and rain-on-snow under nonstationary climate. The NG-IDF curve is an enhancement to the PREC-IDF curve and provides a consistent design approach across rain- to snow-dominated regions, which can benefit engineers and planners responsible for designing climate-resilient facilities, federal emergency agencies responsible for the flood insurance program, and local jurisdictions responsible for developing design manuals and approving subsequent infrastructure designs. Further, we discuss the recent advances in climate and hydrologic science communities that have not been translated into actional information in the engineering community. To bridge the gap, we advocate that building climate-resilient infrastructure goes beyond the traditional local design scale where engineers rely on recipe-based methods only; the future hydrologic design is a multi-scale problem and requires closer collaboration between climate scientists, hydrologists, and civil engineers.}

The simulated storm surge is combined with probabilistic storm rates to create flood maps with various return periods. However, the map production requires enormous computational cost if state-of-the-art hydrodynamic models with high-resolution numerical grids are used; hence, optimal sampling (JPM-OS) with a small number of (\textasciitilde\,100\textendash 200) optimal (representative) storms is preferred. This paper presents a significantly improved JPM-OS, where a small number of optimal storms are objectively selected, and simulated storm surge responses of tens of thousands of storms are accurately interpolated from those for the optimal storms using a highly efficient kriging surrogate model. This study focuses on Southwest Florida and considers\,\textasciitilde\,150 optimal storms that are selected based on simulations using either the low fidelity (with low resolution and simple physics) SLOSH model or the high fidelity (with high resolution and comprehensive physics) CH3D model. Surge responses to the optimal storms are simulated using both SLOSH and CH3D, and the flood elevations are calculated using JPM-OS with highly efficient kriging interpolations. For verification, the probabilistic inundation maps are compared to those obtained by the traditional JPM and variations of JPM-OS that employ different interpolation schemes, and computed probabilistic water levels are compared to those calculated by historical storm methods. The inundation maps obtained with the JPM-OS differ less than 10\% from those obtained with JPM for 20,625 storms, with only 4\% of the computational time.}

  abstract = {Abstract Here we present a machine learning\textendash based wind reconstruction model. The model reconstructs hurricane surface winds with XGBoost, which is a decision-tree-based ensemble predictive algorithm. The model treats the symmetric and asymmetric wind fields separately. The symmetric wind field is approximated by a parametric wind profile model and two Bessel function series. The asymmetric field, accounting for asymmetries induced by the storm and its ambient environment, is represented using a small number of Laplacian eigenfunctions. The coefficients associated with Bessel functions and eigenfunctions are predicted by XGBoost based on storm and environmental features taken from NHC best-track and ERA-Interim data, respectively. We use HWIND for the observed wind fields. Three parametric wind profile models are tested in the symmetric wind model. The wind reconstruction model's performance is insensitive to the choice of the profile model because the Bessel function series correct biases of the parametric profiles. The mean square error of the reconstructed surface winds is smaller than the climatological variance, indicating skillful reconstruction. Storm center location, eyewall size, and translation speed play important roles in controlling the magnitude of the leading asymmetries, while the phase of the asymmetries is mainly affected by storm translation direction. Vertical wind shear impacts the asymmetry phase to a lesser degree. Intended applications of this model include assessing hurricane risk using synthetic storm event sets generated by statistical\textendash dynamical downscaling hurricane models.},

Relatively, the correction factors (CF) are small in summer (10\%), and very large in winter (80\textendash 120\%) because of the increased effect of wind on gauge undercatch of snowfall. The CFs also vary over space particularly in snowfall season. Significant CF differences were found across the USA/Canada borders mainly due to differences in catch efficiency between the national gauges.

The damage associated with high emissions that lead to high temperatures play no role in this calculation. With uncertainty about the link between emissions and temperature, high temperatures can play a role in desired near term mitigation but it will generally be a modest effect. We need to focus scientific attention on policy relevant emission paths and their consequences and pay much less attention to what happens in high emission scenarios.}

However little is known about how changing the spatial composition of landuse could improve climate change resilience. Consideration of climate change impacts when spatially allocating landuse could be a useful and fundamental long term adaptation strategy, particularly for regional planning. Here, we identify climate adaptation scenarios based on existing extents of three landuse classes using multi-objective genetic algorithms for a 9982 km 2 region with 3.5 million inhabitants in South Korea. We selected five objectives for adaptation based on predicted climate change impacts and regional economic conditions: minimization of disaster damage and existing landuse conversion, maximization of rice yield, protection of high species richness areas, and economic value. We generated 17 Pareto landuse scenarios by six weighted combinations of the adaptation objectives. Most scenarios, although varying in magnitude, showed better performance than the current spatial landuse composition for all adaptation objectives, suggesting that some alteration of current landuse patterns could increase overall climate resilience. Given the flexible structure of the optimization model, we expect that regional stakeholders could efficiently generate other scenarios by adjusting model parameters (weighting combinations) or replacing input data (impact maps), and selecting a scenario depending on preference or a number of problem-related factors.}

Here we show that the North Atlantic Oscillation (NAO) correlates with the occurrence of catastrophic floods across Europe and the associated economic losses. The analysis reveals that in Northern Europe the majority of historic winter floods occurred during a positive NAO state, whereas the majority of summer floods occurred during a negative state. Analogous, but stronger, patterns can be observed in individual Atlantic countries. Through the application of a state-of-the-art catastrophe model, we find that there is a statistically significant relationship between the NAO and flood losses. Critically, we observe that the average flood loss during opposite NAO states can differ by up to 50\%. These results can inform financial preparedness and disaster fund allocation, as stakeholders, such as governments and insurance companies, can distribute resources more effectively.},

We develop the Drought Resilient Interscale Portfolio Planning model (DRIPP) to generate optimal planning responses to urban drought. DRIPP is a generalizable multi-scale framework for optimizing dynamic planning strategies of long-term infrastructure deployment and short-term drought response. It integrates climate and hydrological variability with high-fidelity representations of urban water distribution, available technology options, and demand reduction measures to yield robust and cost-effective water supply portfolios that are location-specific. We apply DRIPP in Santa Barbara, California to assess how least cost water supply portfolios vary under different drought scenarios and identify portfolios that are robust across drought scenarios. In Santa Barbara, we find that drought intensity, not duration or frequency, drives cost increases, reliability risk, and regret of overbuilding infrastructure. Under uncertain drought conditions, a diversified technology portfolio that includes both rapidly deployable, decentralized technologies alongside larger centralized technologies minimizes water supply cost while maintaining high robustness to climate uncertainty.}

This recommendation neglects many uncertainties. Here we analyze a case-study of riverine flood risk management using a multi-objective robust decision-making framework in the face of deep uncertainties. While the quantitative results are location-specific, the approach and overall insights are generalizable. We find strong interactions between the economic, engineering, and Earth science uncertainties, illustrating the need for expanding on previous integrated analyses to further understand the nature and strength of these connections. Considering deep uncertainties surrounding flood hazards, the discount rate, the house lifetime, and the fragility can increase the economically optimal house elevation to values well above FEMA's recommendation.},

  abstract = {Reservoir operations are central to our ability to manage river basin systems serving conflicting multi-sectoral demands under increasingly uncertain futures. These challenges motivate the need for new solution strategies capable of effectively and efficiently discovering the multi-sectoral tradeoffs that are inherent to alternative reservoir operation policies. Evolutionary many-objective direct policy search (EMODPS) is gaining importance in this context due to its capability of addressing multiple objectives and its flexibility in incorporating multiple sources of uncertainties. This simulation-optimization framework has high potential for addressing the complexities of water resources management, and it can benefit from current advances in parallel computing and meta-heuristics. This study contributes a diagnostic assessment of state-of-the-art parallel strategies for the auto-adaptive Borg Multi Objective Evolutionary Algorithm (MOEA) to support EMODPS. Our analysis focuses on the Lower Susquehanna River Basin (LSRB) system where multiple sectoral demands from hydropower production, urban water supply, recreation and environmental flows need to be balanced. Using EMODPS with different parallel configurations of the Borg MOEA, we optimize operating policies over different size ensembles of synthetic streamflows and evaporation rates. As we increase the ensemble size, we increase the statistical fidelity of our objective function evaluations at the cost of higher computational demands. This study demonstrates how to overcome the mathematical and computational barriers associated with capturing uncertainties in stochastic multiobjective reservoir control optimization, where parallel algorithmic search serves to reduce the wall-clock time in discovering high quality representations of key operational tradeoffs. Our results show that emerging self-adaptive parallelization schemes exploiting cooperative search populations are crucial. Such strategies provide a promising new set of tools for effectively balancing exploration, uncertainty, and computational demands when using EMODPS.}

  abstract = {As climate change continues to exacerbate hazard losses across the USA, many communities are seeking to permanently reduce their hazard exposure by relocating households out of high-risk areas. In the USA, governments have traditionally relocated households using two mechanisms: buyout programs and eminent domain. Although both programs acquire private properties for public ownership and use, buyout programs are defined as voluntary by government entities, whereas eminent domain is compulsory. For decades, Harris County, Texas, has used both voluntary buyouts and eminent domain to relocate households out of flood-prone areas for different uses; buyouts produce open space, whereas eminent domain is used for flood risk reduction projects Although the literature on buyouts continues to grow, especially related to managed retreat, little research considers mandated relocation in response to hazard in the USA despite the increasing potential and calls for mandated relocations due to sea level rise and other climate-induced hazards. To address this gap in the literature, we analyze county records spanning approximately 100~years to examine the geographic patterns related to Harris County's use of eminent domain and buyouts programs to mitigate flood hazards. Integrating these records into a Geographic Information System, this novel study is the first to compare these two programs and consider the implications for future managed retreat.}

  abstract = {As developing new supply capacity has become increasingly expensive and difficult to permit (i.e., regulatory approval), utilities have become more reliant on temporary demand management programs, such as outdoor water use restrictions, for ensuring reliability during drought. However, a significant fraction of water utility income is often derived from the volumetric sale of water, and such restrictions can lead to substantial revenue losses. Given that many utilities set prices at levels commensurate with recovering costs, these revenue losses can leave them financially vulnerable to budgetary shortfalls. This work explores approaches for mitigating drought-related revenue losses through the use of third-party financial insurance contracts based on streamflow indices. Two different types of contracts are developed, and their efficacy is compared against two more traditional forms of financial hedging used by water utilities: Drought surcharges and contingency funds (i.e., self-insurance). Strategies involving each of these approaches, as well as their use in combination, are applied under conditions facing the water utility serving Durham, North Carolina. A multireservoir model provides information on the scale and timing of droughts, and the financial effects of these events are simulated using detailed data derived from utility billing records. Results suggest that third-party index insurance contracts, either independently or in combination with more traditional hedging tools, can provide an effective means of reducing a utility's financial vulnerability to drought.},

However, less is known about how droughts and heat waves impact the county level distribution of health damages from power plant emissions. Using California as a case study, we simulate emissions from power plants under a 500-year synthetic weather ensemble. We find that human health damages are highest in hot, dry years. Counties with a majority of people of color and counties with high pollution burden (which are somewhat overlapping) are disproportionately impacted by increased emissions from power plants during droughts and heat waves. Taxing power plant operations based on each plant's contribution to health damages significantly reduces average exposure. However, emissions taxes do not reduce air pollution damages on the worst polluting days, because supply scarcity (caused by severe heat waves) forces system operators to use every power plant available to avoid causing a blackout., Heat waves and droughts increase air pollution from power plants in California, which disproportionately damages counties with a majority of people of color. Droughts cause chronic increases in pollution damages. Heat waves are responsible for the days with the highest damages.},

  abstract = {Three different conceptual frameworks of resilience, including engineering, ecological and social\textendash ecological have been presented and framed within the context of flood risk management. Engineering resilience has demonstrated its value in the design and operation of technological systems in general and in flood resilient technologies in particular. Although limited to the technical domain, it has broadened the objectives of flood resilient technologies and provided guidance in improving their effectiveness. Socio-ecological resilience is conceived as a broader system characteristic that involves the interaction between human and natural systems. It acknowledges that these systems change over time and that these interactions are of complex nature and associated with uncertainties. Building (socio-ecological) resilience in flood risk management strategies calls for an adaptive approach with short-term measures and a set of monitoring criteria for keeping track of developments that might require adaptation in the long-term (adaptation pathways) and thus built-in adaptive capacity as opposed to building engineering resilience which involves a static approach with a fixed time horizon a set of robust measures designed for specific future conditions or scenarios. The two case studies, from a developing and a developed country, indicate that the concepts of ecological and socio-ecological resilience provide guidance for building more resilient flood risk management systems resulting in an approach that embraces flood protection, prevention and preparedness. The case studies also reveal that the translation of resilience concepts into practice remains a challenge. One plausible explanation for this is our inability to arrive at a quantification of socio-ecological resilience taking into account the various attributes of the concept.This article is part of the theme issue `Urban flood resilience'.}

This paper estimates the changes in electricity consumption due to temperature fluctuation at the county scale in rural China. By using the statistics of counties from 2006 to 2015 in a fixed-effect panel model, the results indicate that a one-degree temperature increase in summer days may lead to 0.015\% more electricity consumption per capita, and this correlation may be weaker as income increases. Moreover, a one-degree temperature decrease in winter days may lead to 0.002\% more electricity consumption. The northern region may consume 0.021\% more electricity than the southern region when facing the same temperature drop. Overall, the effect of temperature on electricity consumption is modest, particularly for a drop in temperature, but the usage of other types of energy may increase to adapt to the cold.}

In this work, we attempt to achieve truly high-dimensional inference for extremes of spatial processes, while retaining the desirable flexibility in the tail dependence structure, by modifying an established class of models based on scale mixtures Gaussian processes. We show that the desired extremal dependence properties from the original models are preserved under the modification, and demonstrate that the corresponding Bayesian hierarchical model does not involve the expensive computation of the multivariate Gaussian distribution function. We fit our model to exceedances of a high threshold, and perform coverage analyses and cross-model checks to validate its ability to capture different types of tail characteristics. We use a standard adaptive Metropolis algorithm for model fitting, and further accelerate the computation via parallelization and Rcpp. Lastly, we apply the model to a dataset of a fire threat index on the Great Plains region of the United States, which is vulnerable to massively destructive wildfires. We find that the joint tail of the fire threat index exhibits a decaying dependence structure that cannot be captured by limiting extreme value models. Supplementary materials for this article are available online.}

  abstract = {The National Mosaic and Multi-sensor QPE (Quantitative Precipitation Estimation), or ``NMQ'', system was initially developed from a joint initiative between the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration's National Severe Storms Laboratory, the Federal Aviation Administration's Aviation Weather Research Program, and the Salt River Project. Further development has continued with additional support from the National Weather Service (NWS) Office of Hydrologic Development, the NWS Office of Climate, Water, and Weather Services, and the Central Weather Bureau of Taiwan. The objectives of NMQ research and development (R\&D) are 1) to develop a hydrometeorological platform for assimilating different observational networks toward creating high spatial and temporal resolution multisensor QPEs for f lood warnings and water resource management and 2) to develop a seamless high-resolution national 3D grid of radar reflectivity for severe weather detection, data assimilation, numerical weather prediction model verification, and aviation product development. Through about ten years of R\&D, a real-time NMQ system has been implemented (http://nmq.ou.edu). Since June 2006, the system has been generating high-resolution 3D reflectivity mosaic grids (31 vertical levels) and a suite of severe weather and QPE products in real-time for the conterminous United States at a 1-km horizontal resolution and 2.5 minute update cycle. The experimental products are provided in real-time to end users ranging from government agencies, universities, research institutes, and the private sector and have been utilized in various meteorological, aviation, and hydrological applications. Further, a number of operational QPE products generated from different sensors (radar, gauge, satellite) and by human experts are ingested in the NMQ system and the experimental products are evaluated against the operational products as well as independent gauge observations in real time. The NMQ is a fully automated system. It facilitates systematic evaluations and advances of hydrometeorological sciences and technologies in a real-time environment and serves as a test bed for rapid science-to-operation infusions. This paper describes scientific components of the NMQ system and presents initial evaluation results and future development plans of the system.},

It was found that RWB perturbs the wind and moisture fields throughout the troposphere in the vicinity of a breaking wave. When RWB occurs more frequently over the North Atlantic, the Atlantic main development region (MDR) is subject to stronger vertical wind shear and reduced tropospheric moisture; the basinwide TC counts are reduced, and TCs are generally less intense, have a shorter lifetime, and are less likely to make landfalls. A significant negative correlation was found between Atlantic TC activity and RWB occurrence during 1979\textendash 2013. The correlation is comparable to that with the MDR SST index and stronger than that with the Ni\~no-3.4 index. Further analyses suggest that the variability of RWB occurrence in the western Atlantic is largely independent of that in the eastern Atlantic. The RWB occurrence in the...}

  abstract = {It is widely acknowledged that distributed water systems (DWSs), which integrate distributed water supply and treatment with existing centralized infrastructure, can mitigate challenges to water security from extreme events, climate change, and aged infrastructure. However, it is unclear which are beneficial DWS configurations, i.e., where and at what scale to implement distributed water supply. We develop a mesoscale representation model that approximates DWSs with reduced backbone networks to enable efficient system emulation while preserving key physical realism. Moreover, system emulation allows us to build a multiobjective optimization model for computational policy search that addresses energy utilization and economic impacts. We demonstrate our models on a hypothetical DWS with distributed direct potable reuse (DPR) based on the City of Houston's water and wastewater infrastructure. The backbone DWS with greater than link and node reductions achieves satisfactory approximation of global flows and water pressures, to enable configuration optimization analysis. Results from the optimization model reveal case-specific as well as general opportunities, constraints, and their interactions for DPR allocation. Implementing DPR can be beneficial in areas with high energy intensities of water distribution, considerable local water demands, and commensurate wastewater reuse capacities. The mesoscale modeling approach and the multiobjective optimization model developed in this study can serve as practical decision-support tools for stakeholders to search for alternative DWS options in urban settings.},

Choosing Houston as an example, we demonstrate that there will be significantly elevated risk of TC rainfall and flood in the future warming world by coupling downscaled TCs from Model Intercomparison Project Phase 6 models with physical hydrological models. We find that slower TC translation speed, more frequent stalling, greater TC frequency, and increased rain rate are major contributors to increased TC rainfall risk and flood risk. The TC flood risk increases more than the rainfall. Smaller watersheds with a high degree of urbanization are particularly vulnerable to future changes in TC floods in a warming world.}

  abstract = {Concerns over the impacts of urban growth have prompted the development and adoption of water-demand management strategies. Water and energy savings from increasingly efficient technologies, diversified water sources, and water savings policies are typically quantified from an individual demand-side basis, but network-wide potential is not well studied. This paper studies the effects of residential demand profiles on the performance of urban water networks, in response to emerging demand management strategies. Hydraulic simulations were conducted to assess the performance of base and conservation demand scenarios. Five metrics of network performance are suggested to evaluate responses to scenarios: water loss, water age, peak flow, energy input, and loss. The results revealed that network performance for energy and flow metrics improved under the conservation scenario; however, the conservation scenario had a negative impact on water age and losses throughout the network. The results indicate that the potential benefits from these demand profiles cannot be fully realized without adjustments in network operation and may come at a cost in terms of water quality. This work suggests an initial tool for evaluating networkwide effects of demand management strategies.

The test is positive if the time series includes the seasonal variation, but negative if it only represents the anomaly, i.e., the deviation from the seasonal cycle. The results indicate that deterministic, low-dimensional, and nonlinear dynamics in ENSO is associated with the seasonal cycle, and that the dynamics determining the interannual timing and strength of El Ni\~no/La Ni\~na episodes is high-dimensional/stochastic. Application of stochastic forcing to a time-delay equation for equatorial-wave dynamics can reproduce stochastic dynamics and other important aspects of ENSO. Without such stochastic forcing, this model yields deterministic, low-dimensional dynamics. With stochastic forcing, our test still yields such dynamics if the seasonal cycle is retained, but does not if the annual cycle is subtracted before the test is applied. The model results illustrate that the seasonal variability can be governed by low-dimensional nonlinear dynamics, while the interannual variability associated with ENSO is dominated by the stochastic forcing.},

The book demonstrates how HMMs can be applied to a wide range of types of time series: continuous-valued, circular, multivariate, binary, bounded and unbounded counts, and categorical observations. It also discusses how to employ the freely available computing environment R to carry out the computations. --},

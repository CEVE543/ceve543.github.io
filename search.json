    "section": "A Community of Learning",
    "text": "A Community of Learning\nRice’s core values are responsibility, integrity, community, and excellence. Our goal is to create a learning community aligned with these core values.\n\nExpectations\nThe goal of our course is to help you gain competancy and knowledge in the areas of environmental data science and climate risk assessment. This involves a dual responsibility on the part of the instructor and the student.\nAs the instructor, my responsibility is to provide you with a structure and opportunity to learn. To this end, I will commit to:\n\nprovide organized and focused lectures, in-class activities, and assignments;\nencourage students to regularly evaluate and provide feedback on the course;\nmanage the classroom atmosphere to promote learning;\nschedule sufficient out-of-class contact opportunities, such as office hours;\nallow adequate time for assignment completion;\nmake lecture materials, class policies, activities, and assignments accessible to students.\n\nStudents are encouraged to discuss any concerns with me during office hours or through a course communications channel. Students are responsible for their own learning in the course and should commit to:\n\nattending all lectures;\ndoing all required preparatory work before class;\nactively participating in online and in-class discussions;\nbeginning assignments and other work early; and\nattending office hours as needed.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCanvas Discussions\n\n\n\n\nIf you wait until the day an assignment is due (or even late the previous night) to ask a question on Canvas, there is a strong chance that I will not see your post prior to the deadline.\nBut if you see unanswered questions and you have some insight, please answer! This class will work best when we all work together as a community.\n\n\n\n\n\nDiversity, Equity, and Inclusion\nRice is committed to building and maintaining an equitable and inclusive campus community. Diversity can refer to multiple ways that we identify ourselves, including but not limited to race, color, national origin, language, sex, disability, age, sexual orientation, gender identity, religion, creed, ancestry, belief, veteran status, or genetic information. Each of these diverse identities, along with many others not mentioned here, shape the perspectives our students, faculty, and staff bring to our campus. We, at Rice, will work to promote diversity, equity and inclusion not only because diversity fuels excellence and innovation, but because we want to pursue justice. We acknowledge our imperfections while we also fully commit to the work, inside and outside of our classrooms, of building and sustaining a campus community that increasingly embraces these core values.\nEach of us is responsible for creating a safer, more inclusive environment. Unfortunately, incidents of bias or discrimination do occur, whether intentional or unintentional. They contribute to creating an unwelcoming environment for individuals and groups at the university.\n\n\nAccommodation for Students with Disabilities\nIf you have a documented disability or other condition that may affect academic performance you should: 1) make sure this documentation is on file with the Disability Resource Center (Allen Center, Room 111 / adarice@rice.edu / x5841) to determine the accommodations you need; and 2) talk with me to discuss your accommodation needs.\n\n\nAccommodation for Scheduling Conflicts\nIf any of our class meetings conflict with your religious events, student athletics, or other non-negotiable scheduling conflict, please let me know ASAP so that we can make arrangements for you.\n\n\nMask Policies\nMasks are encouraged but not required in the classroom. However, the University strongly encourages compliance with requests to mask from students, faculty, and staff who are concerned about the risk of infection. Please be respectful of these concerns and requests and do not ask someone making such a request to disclose their underlying medical condition."

    "section": "Policies",
    "text": "Policies\n\nAttendance\nAttendance is not required and will not be counted every class, but in general, students who attend class regularly will do better and get more out of the class than students who do not. Your class participation grade will reflect both the quantity and quality of your participation, only some of which can occur asynchronously. I will put as many course materials, such as lecture notes and announcements, as possible online, but viewing materials online is not the same as active participation and engagement. Life happens, of course, and this may lead you to miss class. Let me know if you need any appropriate arrangements ahead of time.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWhat If I’m Sick?\n\n\n\nPlease stay home if you’re feeling sick! This is beneficial for both for your own recovery and the health and safety of your classmates. We will also make any necessary arrangements for you to stay on top of the class material and if whatever is going on will negatively impact your grade, for example by causing you to be unable to submit an assignment on time.\n\n\n\n\nPolicy on Web Posting of Course Materials\nUploading course materials to web sites is not an authorized use of the course material. Both the poster and the user are in violation of the university policy, which is actionable.\n\n\nAcademic Integrity\nThis class is designed to encourage collaboration, and students are encouraged to discuss their work with other students. Engineering as a profession relies upon the honesty and integrity of its practitioners (see e.g. the American Society for Civil Engineers’ Code of Ethics). All work submitted must represent the students’ own work and understanding, whether individually or as a group (depending on the particulars of the assignment). This includes analyses, code, software runs, and reports.\nMore specifically, all students will be held to the standards of the Rice Honor Code, a code that you pledged to honor when you matriculated at this institution. If you are unfamiliar with the details of this code and how it is administered, you should consult the Honor System Handbook at honor.rice.edu/honor-system-handbook/. This handbook outlines the University’s expectations for the integrity of your academic work, the procedures for resolving alleged violations of those expectations, and the rights and responsibilities of students and faculty members throughout the process.\nIf you are ever unclear about academic integrity, please ask! Additionally, always err on the side of providing more information.)\n\n\nAI/ML Resource Policy\nAI/ML tools, like ChatGPT, can be incredibly powerful aids in learning, and can help beginner programmers with syntax and code structure. However, the use of these tools poses risks including the potential for plagiarism and the potential for students to rely on these tools without developing their own understanding.\nAs noted, all work submitted for a grade in this course must reflect your own understanding. You are welcome to use AI/ML tools to help you learn, but you must describe how you used the tool when you turn in your assignment. Moreover, you should not submit code that you do not understand as you be held responsible for explaining any code you submit.\n\n\nLate Work Policy\nLate projects will be subjected to a 10% penalty per day, which can accumulate to 100% of the total grade. Late homework and labs will not be accepted, because we will discuss the solutions in class.\nSometimes things come up in life. Please reach out ahead of time if you have extenuating circumstances (including University-approved absences or illnesses) which would make it difficult for you to submit your work on time. Work which would be late for appropriate reasons will be given extensions and the late penalty will be waived."

    "text": "Grading\n\nLab Notebooks: 10%\nSome classes will involve hands-on exercises (which we will call “labs”) which will give you guided practice applying the concepts and methods from class. These labs will be announced on the course website ahead of time so anyone who is able can bring a laptop to class. These labs can be done in groups; if you cannot bring a laptop to class for whatever reason, you will be able to (and are encouraged to) work with other students, though you must turn in your own assignment for grading.\nSome details on lab logistics:\n\nLabs will be designed to be completed in class, but you may occasionally require additional time to complete them.\nRubrics will be provided for lab grading as part of the lab assignments.\n\n\n\nTests: 40%\nIn-class written exams will be given for each of the four modules of the course, on the dates listed on the schedule. Tests will cover material from lectures and labs, and we will dedicate a class to review before each exam.\n\n\nProjects: 40%\nThe second, third, and fourth modules of the class will culminate with a project. The goal of these project is to apply the tools we learn in class to a real-world problem. You can think of these projects as a “mini-capstone” for each module, and should take the time of a long problem set.\nSpecific instructions and rubrics will be provided for each project. You will turn in your project as a Quarto notebook (.qmd file) and a rendered PDF. Climate risk analyses are communicated to a wide range of audiences, including a skeptical scientist, a trial lawyer, the manager of a banking risk management team, or an interested policy-maker. Each project will require you to communicate your results to a different audience, and you will be graded on how well you communicate your results to that audience.\n\n\nParticipation: 10%\nParticipating fully in the class allows you to gain more from the class and contribute more to the learning of your classmates. Some ways to participate include:\n\nAttending every class\nAsking questions in class\nAnswering questions on Canvas\nComing to office hours\n\nYou will be asked to evaluate your own participation over the course of the semester, and I will provide feedback on your participation as well"

    "section": "Introduction",
    "text": "Introduction\n\nJulia\nJulia is an up-and-coming language, originally developed for scientific programming. While learning a new programming language always has its hiccups, the good news is that if you’ve programmed in a high-level language such as Python or MATLAB, most Julia concepts should look familiar.\nIf you have not successfully set up Julia, follow the instructions in Tools Setup and/or ask for help.\nYou can use other editors for this course, but our recommendation is Visual Studio Code with the Julia extension, which will make life a lot simpler! You should have set this up by following the Tools Setup instructions, but if not, do so now and/or ask for help.\n\n\nJupyter Notebooks\nJupyter notebooks integrate text and equations in Markdown with Julia (or Python, or R) code. To do this, Jupyter notebooks consist of two types of “cells”: code cells and Markdown (text) cells.\nClick once on this section of text. A box will appear around this text (and some areas above/below it) - all of that is within this cell.\nMarkdown is a text markup framework for formatting language that makes things look pretty when viewed across different platforms: web browsers, notebooks, and so forth. Text written in Markdown can also include hyperlinks, LaTeX equations, section headers, and images, among other features (most of the course website and the lecture notes were all written in Markdown!). Here is a basic Markdown cheat sheet.\nWhat you are looking at right now is the formatted text after the Markdown is processed. To see the raw Markdown, do one of:\n\npress Enter while that cell is selected, or\ndouble-click on that cell.\n\n\nA couple of the features you will see in this Markdown cell:\n\nThe --- command creates a horizontal line. This is also nice for separating sections.\nBackticks (`...`) can be used to format and highlight code, keystrokes, etc.\nThe # sign is used to create a new section header; two # signs (##) is used to create a new subsection header; ### creates a subsubsection, and so on.\nYou can create a bulleted list by using the asterisk * or a dash - and a space.\nYou can create regular text by just typing as usual.\nYou can create bold-faced text by wrapping it with two asterisks on both sides.\nYou can create italicized text by wrapping it with a single asterisk on both sides.\nTo create a new paragraph, you must include a blank line between the old and new paragraphs.\n\nAt this point you might be wondering how to turn this cell back into the fully formatted Markdown text instead of the raw Markdown you’re probably still looking at. You have a couple of options, depending on your platform, but the most consistent is to type Shift + Enter to execute the cell (this is also how to run code, but more on that later).\nAdditionally, you will frequently need to create new cells in your Jupyter notebooks. How you do this will depend on how you interact with the notebook, but try to figure this out now.\nOne tip is to think carefully about what bits of code should be in the same cell, as you typically only see output from the last command in a cell. For example, compare the following:\n\nx = 5\nsin(x)\n\n-0.9589242746631385\n\n\nwith\n\nx = 5\n\n5\n\n\n\nsin(x)\n\n-0.9589242746631385\n\n\nIn Julia, you can also suppress the output of a command with a semi-colon:\n\nsin(x);\n\nwhich can help if you want to split some code out for clarity or to insert some text prior to it, but don’t want to clutter the notebook with its output.\nFor code cells, to execute the commands within the cell, we also press Shift+Enter.\nFinally, make sure that you evaluate all of the code cells in order before submitting. One bad outcome with notebooks occurs when cells are evaluated out of order, so fixed bugs and edits in previous cells do not get a chance to propagate down. You can do this with the Run All command in whichever interface you’re using to edit your notebook.\n\n\nJulia Basics\nThere are many tutorials and references for Julia, including a basics overview on the class website. Please feel free to reference these as you work through any part of the course.\n\n\nFormatting Math\nIt will often be helpful to include nicely-formatted mathematics in a notebook. Markdown accomodates this using LaTeX syntax. A LaTeX cheatsheet is available on the class website, and many other guides exist online.\nBelow is an example of a formatted equation: \\[x = 5.\\]\n\n\nLooking For Help\nThere is no shame in using Google, or other resources, for help when programming. There are many, many times when you can’t quite get the syntax to work, can’t quite figure out the right package or command to use, or are feeling too lazy or overwhelmed (I’m not judging either of those!) to dig through the documentation. Some good resources include:\n\nStack Overflow is a treasure trove of answers;\nThe official Julia forum and the Julia Subreddit are also very useful.\n\nYou are also highly encouraged to post on Ed Discussion, though getting a response might be less immediate. Just be mindful that to get good answers, you have to help people help you, and make sure to give credit to any resources that were helpful!"

This will make sure all output is visible and that the code cells were evaluated in the correct order.\nTag each of the problems when you submit to Gradescope; a 10% penalty will be deducted if this is not done.\n\n\nExercise 1\nGiven two numeric arrays x and y, write a function to compute their dot product if they have equal length, and return an error if not (this is useful for debugging!). Use the following code as a starting point.\n\nfunction dot_product(x, y)\n    if ... # insert test condition for equal lengths\n        # compute and return dot product\n    else\n        throw(DimensionMismatch(\"length of x not equal to length of y\"))\n    end\nend\n\nHere are some tests to make sure your code works as intended. Tests like these are useful to make sure everything works as intended. One reason to split your code up into functions is that it makes it straightforward to write tests to make sure each piece of your code works, which makes it easier to identify where errors are occuring.\n\ndot_product([1 2 3], [4 5 6])\n\nIf you know the value you should get, you can write a more formal test using the @assert macro, which is a good way to “automate” checking (since you get an obvious error if the code doesn’t work as desired):\n\n@assert dot_product([1 2 3], [4 5 6]) == 32\n\nLet’s also make sure we get an error when the dimensions of the two vectors don’t match:\n\ndot_product([1 2 3], [4 5])\n\n\n\nExercise 2\nThis problem involves implementing Newton’s method for computing square roots; it was shamelessly copied from MIT’s Introduction to Computational Thinking. You will use a while loop instead of the for loop shown above.\nImplement the following algorithm in a function newton_sqrt:\nGiven \\(x &gt; 0\\):\n\nTake a guess \\(a\\).\nDivide \\(x\\) by \\(a\\).\n\nUpdate \\(a\\) as the average of \\(x/a\\) and \\(a\\).\nRepeat until \\(x/a\\) is within a tolerance of \\(\\varepsilon\\) from \\(a\\).\nReturn \\(a \\approx \\sqrt{x}\\).\n\n\n# insert your code here\n\nUse your newton_sqrt function to compute \\(\\sqrt{2}\\) to within a tolerance of \\(\\varepsilon = 0.01\\).\n\n# insert your code here\n\n\n\nExercise 3: Making a Plot\nWrite a function to compute the square of an integer x. Evaluate this function for integers between \\(x=-5\\) and \\(x=5\\) and make a plot of the squared values (you can find a quick guide to making various types of plots here). Make sure to label your axes.\n\n# insert your code here"

The original coder was not very considerate of other potential users: the function is called mystery_function and there are no comments explaining the purpose of the code. It appears to take in an array and return some numbers, and you’ve been assured that the code works as intended.\n\n\nfunction mystery_function(values)\n    y = []\n    for v in values\n        if !(v in y)\n            append!(y, v)\n        end\n    end\n    return y\nend\n\nlist_of_values = [1, 2, 3, 4, 3, 4, 2, 1]\n@show mystery_function(list_of_values);\n\nmystery_function(list_of_values) = Any[1, 2, 3, 4]\n\n\n\nProblem 3.1 (10 points)\nExplain the purpose of mystery_function.\n\n\nProblem 3.2 (10 points)\nAdd comments to the code, explaining why and how it works. Refer to “Best Practices for Writing Code Comments”, and remember that bad comments can be just as bad as no comments at all. You do not need to add comments to every line (in fact, this is very bad practice), but you should note the purpose of every “section” of code, and add comments explaining any code sequences that you don’t immediately understand.\n\n\nProblem 4 (40 points)\nCheap Plastic Products, Inc. is operating a plant that produces \\(100 \\text{m}^3\\text{/day}\\) of wastewater that is discharged into Pristine Brook. The wastewater contains \\(1 \\text{kg/m}^3\\) of YUK, a toxic substance. The US Environmental Protection Agency has imposed an effluent standard on the plant prohibiting discharge of more than \\(20 \\text{kg/day}\\) of YUK into Pristine Brook.\nCheap Plastic Products has analyzed two methods for reducing its discharges of YUK. Method 1 is land disposal, which costs \\(X_1^2/20\\) dollars per day, where \\(X_1\\) is the amount of wastewater disposed of on the land (\\(\\text{m}^3\\text{/day}\\)). With this method, 20% of the YUK applied to the land will eventually drain into the stream (i.e., 80% of the YUK is removed by the soil).\nMethod 2 is a chemical treatment procedure which costs $1.50 per \\(\\text{m}^3\\) of wastewater treated. The chemical treatment has an efficiency of \\(e= 1 - 0.005X_2\\), where \\(X_2\\) is the quantity of wastewater (\\(\\text{m}^3\\text{/day}\\)) treated. For example, if \\(X_2 = 50 \\text{m}^3\\text{/day}\\), then \\(e = 1 - 0.005(50) = 0.75\\), so that 75% of the YUK is removed.\nCheap Plastic Products is wondering how to allocate their wastewater between these three disposal and treatment methods (land disposal, and chemical treatment, and land disposal) to meet the effluent standard while keeping costs manageable.\n\n\nProblem 4.1 (10 points)\nThe flow of wastewater through this treatment system is shown in Figure 1. Modify the edge labels (by editing the edge_labels dictionary in the code producing Figure 1) to show how the wastewater allocations result in the final YUK discharge into Pristine Brook. For the edge_label dictionary, the tuple \\((i, j)\\) corresponds to the arrow going from node \\(i\\) to node \\(j\\). The syntax for any entry is (i, j) =&gt; \"label text\", and the label text can include mathematical notation if the string is prefaced with an L, as in L\"x_1\" will produce \\(x_1\\).\n\n\nusing GraphRecipes, Plots\n\nA = [0 1 1 1;\n    0 0 0 1;\n    0 0 0 1;\n    0 0 0 0]\n\nnames = [\"Plant\", \"Land Treatment\", \"Chem Treatment\", \"Pristine Brook\"]\n# modify this dictionary to add labels\nedge_labels = Dict((1, 2) =&gt; \"\", (1,3) =&gt; \"\", (1, 4) =&gt; \"\",(2, 4) =&gt; \"\",(3, 4) =&gt; \"\")\nshapes=[:hexagon, :rect, :rect, :hexagon]\nxpos = [0, -1.5, -0.25, 1]\nypos = [1, 0, 0, -1]\n\ngraphplot(A, names=names,edgelabel=edge_labels, markersize=0.15, markershapes=shapes, markercolor=:white, x=xpos, y=ypos)\n\n\n\n\n\n  \n    \n  \n\n\n\n  \n    \n  \n\n\n\n  \n    \n  \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 1: System diagram of the wastewater treatment options in Problem 4.\n\n\n\n\nProblem 4.2 (10 points)\nFormulate a mathematical model for the treatment cost and the amount of YUK that will be discharged into Pristine Brook based on the wastewater allocations. This is best done with some equations and supporting text explaining the derivation. Make sure you include, as additional equations in the model, any needed constraints on relevant values.

    "section": "The Shallow Lake Problem",
    "text": "The Shallow Lake Problem\n\nOverview\nEutrophication is a common environmental problem in which plants and algae feed on excess nutrients and become overabundant. The large mass of plants and algae have several noxious effects on the ecosystem, including:\n\nhypoxia (reduction in oxygen from the decomposition of organic matter), leading to “dead zones”;\nacidification (from the CO2 produced by decomposition);\nreduced sunlight (from an accumulation of surface algae);\nclogged water intakes; and\nreduction in recreational value and drinking water quality.\n\nIn lakes, eutrophication is often caused by excess input of nutrients (particularly phosphorous, P), which can come from point sources (such as industrial processes) and/or non-point sources (such as agricultural runoff). As the P releases are related to economic activity, we can view this (simplified) lake management problem from the perspective of a tradeoff between economic benefits and the health of the lake: while there are benefits to the activities which lead to P releases, there are recreational, aesthetic, and ecological benefits to maintaining the lake in a non-eutrophic (or oligotrophic) state.\n\n\nModel Formulation\nSuppose we have a town which emits phosphorous into a lake as a by-product of economic activity. The level of P in the lake at a given time \\(t\\) is given by \\(X_t\\) (for the purposes of this problem, we will just treat all values as dimensionless).\nThe level of controllable P release in year \\(t\\) is \\(a_t\\). The lake also receives random levels of phosphorous from non-point source runoff, which we denote by \\(y_t\\). We model these random runoffs using a lognormal distribution \\(LogNormal(\\mu, \\sigma^2)\\), which ensures that the runoffs cannot be negative.\nThere is also some nutrient cycling in the lake which naturally reduces phosphorous concentrations. This cycling is the result of accumulation in the sediment and turnover (water motion disturbing the sediment and carrying the nutrients upwards) and consumers, such as mussels. This cycling is dependent on the state \\(X_t\\), \\(\\frac{X_t^q}{1 + X_t^q}\\). The lake also loses some of its P each time period of its due to outflows and consumption, which we assume is linearly proportional to the state, \\(bX_t\\).\n\n\n\nShallow Lake Problem Diagram\n\n\nAs a result, the lake dynamics are given by:\n\\[X_{t+1} = X_t + a_t + y_t + \\frac{X_t^q}{1 + X_t^q} - bX_t, \\quad y_t \\sim LogNormal(\\mu, \\sigma^2),\\]\nwhere parameter interpretation is given in the table below.\n\nLake problem parameters\n\n\nParameter\nDefinition\nUnits\n\n\n\n\n\\(X_t\\)\nP concentration in lake\ndimensionless\n\n\n\\(a_t\\)\npoint source P input\ndimensionless\n\n\n\\(y_t\\)\nnon-point source P input\ndimensionless\n\n\n\\(q\\)\nP recycling rate\ndimensionless\n\n\n\\(b\\)\nrate at which P is lost\ndimensionless"

The black line is the P recycling level (for $q=2.5), which adds P back into the lake, and the dashed lines correspond to differerent rates of P outflow (based on the linear parameter \\(b\\)). The lake P level is in equilibrium when the recycling rate equals the outflows. When the outflow is greater than the recycling flux, the lake’s P level decreases, and when the recycling flux is greater than the outflow, the P level naturally increases. The red lines show the direction of this net flux.\n\n\n\nBased on Figure 1, we can see that there are typically three equilibria: a stable equilibrium at \\(X=0\\), an unstable, oligotrophic equilibrium \\(X_o\\), and a stable, eutrophic equilibrium \\(X_e\\). When \\(X_t &lt; X_o\\), the lake tends towards a zero P level without external inputs, while when \\(X_t &gt; X_o\\), the lake will inevitably undergo eutrophication, as the P level will tend towards \\(X_e\\). This means that \\(X_t=X_o\\) corresponds to a tipping point: beyond that level, the lake will abruptly switch to a eutrophic state from which it cannot recover.\nThis lake is subject to a bifurcation depending on the values of \\(b\\) and \\(q\\). To see this, let’s fix \\(q=2.5\\), as in Figure 1. For \\(b=0.4\\), there are the two equilibria mentioned previously. However, when \\(b=0.2\\), there is only the unstable equilibrium \\(X=X_o\\) in addition to \\(X=0\\). For \\(b=0.6\\), the only equilibrium is \\(X=0\\), so any positive P input would result in eutrophication.

Julia types are similar to C types, in that they require not only the type of data (Int, Float, String, etc), but also the precision (which is related to the amount of memory allocated to the variable). Issues with precision won’t be a big deal in this class, though they matter when you’re concerned about performance vs. decimal accuracy of code.\nYou can identify the type of a variable or expression with the typeof() function.\n\ntypeof(\"This is a string.\")\n\nString\n\n\n\ntypeof(x)\n\nInt64\n\n\n\nNumeric types\nA key distinction is between an integer type (or Int) and a floating-point number type (or float). Integers only hold whole numbers, while floating-point numbers correspond to numbers with fractional (or decimal) parts. For example, 9 is an integer, while 9.25 is a floating point number. The difference between the two has to do with the way the number is stored in memory. 9, an integer, is handled differently in memory than 9.0, which is a floating-point number, even though they’re mathematically the same value.\n\ntypeof(9)\n\nInt64\n\n\n\ntypeof(9.25)\n\nFloat64\n\n\nSometimes certain function specifications will require you to use a Float variable instead of an Int.

    "text": "Functions\nA function is an object which accepts a tuple of arguments and maps them to a return value. In Julia, functions are defined using the following syntax.\n\nfunction my_actual_function(x, y)\n    return x + y\nend\nmy_actual_function(3, 5)\n\n8\n\n\nFunctions in Julia do not require explicit use of a return statement. They will return the last expression evaluated in their definition. However, it’s good style to explicitly return function outputs. This improves readability and debugging, especially when functions can return multiple expressions based on logical control flows (if-then-else blocks).\nFunctions in Julia are objects, and can be treated like other objects. They can be assigned to new variables or passed as arguments to other functions.\n\ng = my_actual_function\ng(3, 5)\n\n8\n\n\n\nfunction function_of_functions(f, x, y)\n    return f(x, y)\nend\nfunction_of_functions(g, 3, 5)\n\n8\n\n\n\nShort and Anonymous Functions\nIn addition to the long form of the function definition shown above, simple functions can be specified in more compact forms when helpful.\nThis is the short form:\n\nh₁(x) = x^2 # make the subscript using \\_1 + &lt;TAB&gt;\nh₁(4)\n\n16\n\n\nThis is the anonymous form:\n\nx-&gt;sin(x)\n(x-&gt;sin(x))(π/4)\n\n0.7071067811865475\n\n\n\n\nMutating Functions\nThe convention in Julia is that functions should not modify (or mutate) their input data. The reason for this is to ensure that the data is preserved. Mutating functions are mainly appropriate for applications where performance needs to be optimized, and making a copy of the input data would be too memory-intensive.\nIf you do write a mutating function in Julia, the convention is to add a ! to its name, like my_mutating_function!(x).\n\n\nOptional arguments\nThere are two extremes with regard to function parameters which do not always need to be changed. The first is to hard-code them into the function body, which has a clear downside: when you do want to change them, the function needs to be edited directly. The other extreme is to treat them as regular arguments, passing them every time the function is called. This has the downside of potentially creating bloated function calls, particularly when there is a standard default value that makes sense for most function evaluations.\nMost modern languages, including Julia, allow an alternate solution, which is to make these arguments optional. This involves setting a default value, which is used unless the argument is explicitly defined in a function call.\n\nfunction setting_optional_arguments(x, y, c=0.5)\n    return c * (x + y)\nend\n\nsetting_optional_arguments (generic function with 2 methods)\n\n\nIf we want to stick with the fixed value \\(c=0.5\\), all we have to do is call setting_optional_arguments with the x and y arguments.\n\nsetting_optional_arguments(3, 5)\n\n4.0\n\n\nOtherwise, we can pass a new value for c.\n\nsetting_optional_arguments(3, 5, 2)\n\n16\n\n\n\n\nPassing data structures as arguments\nInstead of passing variables individually, it may make sense to pass a data structure, such as an array or a tuple, and then unpacking within the function definition. This is straightforward in long form: access the appropriate elements using their index.\nIn short or anonymous form, there is a trick which allows the use of readable variables within the function definition.\n\nh₂((x,y)) = x*y # enclose the input arguments in parentheses to tell Julia to expect and unpack a tuple\n\nh₂ (generic function with 1 method)\n\n\n\nh₂((2, 3)) # this works perfectly, as we passed in a tuple\n\n6\n\n\n\nh₂(2, 3) # this gives an error, as h₂ expects a single tuple, not two different numeric values\n\nLoadError: MethodError: no method matching h₂(::Int64, ::Int64)\n\n\u001b[0mClosest candidates are:\n\u001b[0m  h₂(::Any)\n\u001b[0m\u001b[90m   @\u001b[39m \u001b[32mMain\u001b[39m \u001b[90m\u001b[4mIn[50]:1\u001b[24m\u001b[39m\n\n\n\nh₂([3, 10]) # this also works with arrays instead of tuples\n\n30\n\n\n\n\nVectorized operations\nJulia uses dot syntax to vectorize an operation and apply it element-wise across an array.\nFor example, to calculate the square root of 3:\n\nsqrt(3)\n\n1.7320508075688772\n\n\nTo calculate the square roots of every integer between 1 and 5:\n\nsqrt.([1, 2, 3, 4, 5])\n\n5-element Vector{Float64}:\n 1.0\n 1.4142135623730951\n 1.7320508075688772\n 2.0\n 2.23606797749979\n\n\nThe same dot syntax is used for arithmetic operations over arrays, since these operations are really functions.\n\n[1, 2, 3, 4] .* 2\n\n4-element Vector{Int64}:\n 2\n 4\n 6\n 8\n\n\nVectorization can be faster and is more concise to write and read than applying the same function to multiple variables or objects explicitly, so take advantage!\n\n\nReturning multiple values\nYou can return multiple values by separating them with a comma. This implicitly causes the function to return a tuple of values.\n\nfunction return_multiple_values(x, y)\n    return x + y, x * y\nend\nreturn_multiple_values(3, 5)\n\n(8, 15)\n\n\nThese values can be unpacked into multiple variables.\n\nn, ν = return_multiple_values(3, 5)\nn\n\n8\n\n\n\nν\n\n15\n\n\n\n\nReturning nothing\nSometimes you don’t want a function to return any values at all. For example, you might want a function that only prints a string to the console.\n\nfunction print_some_string(x)\n    println(\"x: $x\")\n    return nothing\nend\nprint_some_string(42)\n\nx: 42"

    "text": "Control Flows\nOne of the tricky things about learning a new programming language can be getting used to the specifics of control flow syntax. These types of flows include conditional if-then-else statements or loops.\n\nConditional Blocks\nConditional blocks allow different pieces of code to be evaluated depending on the value of a boolean expression or variable. For example, if we wanted to compute the absolute value of a number, rather than using abs():\n\nfunction our_abs(x)\n    if x &gt;= 0\n        return x\n    else\n        return -x\n    end\nend\n\nour_abs (generic function with 1 method)\n\n\n\nour_abs(4)\n\n4\n\n\n\nour_abs(-4)\n\n4\n\n\nTo nest conditional statements, use elseif.\n\nfunction test_sign(x)\n    if x &gt; 0\n        return Text(\"x is positive.\")\n    elseif x &lt; 0\n        return Text(\"x is negative.\")\n    else\n        return Text(\"x is zero.\")\n    end\nend\n\ntest_sign (generic function with 1 method)\n\n\n\ntest_sign(-5)\n\nx is negative.\n\n\n\ntest_sign(0)\n\nx is zero.\n\n\n\n\nLoops\nLoops allow expressions to be evaluated repeatedly until they are terminated. The two main types of loops are while loops and for loops.\n\nWhile loops\nwhile loops continue to evaluate an expression so long as a specified boolean condition is true. This is useful when you don’t know how many iterations it will take for the desired goal to be reached.\n\nfunction compute_factorial(x)\n    factorial = 1\n    while (x &gt; 1)\n        factorial *= x\n        x -= 1\n    end\n    return factorial\nend\ncompute_factorial(5)\n\n120\n\n\n\nWhile loops can easily turn into infinite loops if the condition is never meaningfully updated. Be careful, and look there if your programs are getting stuck. Also, If the expression in a while loop is false when the loop is reached, the loop will never be evaluated.\n\n\n\nFor loops\nfor loops run for a finite number of iterations, based on some defined index variable.\n\nfunction add_some_numbers(x)\n    total_sum = 0 # initialize at zero since we're adding\n    for i=1:x # the counter i is updated every iteration\n        total_sum += i\n    end\n    return total_sum\nend\nadd_some_numbers(4)\n\n10\n\n\nfor loops can also iterate over explicitly passed containers, rather than iterating over an incrementally-updated index sequence. Use the in keyword when defining the loop.\n\nfunction add_passed_numbers(set)\n    total_sum = 0\n    for i in set # this is the syntax we use when we want i to correspond to different container values\n        total_sum += i\n    end\n    return total_sum\nend\nadd_passed_numbers([1, 3, 5])\n\n9"

If you haven’t, download the appropriate version for your operating system.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMac Versions\n\n\n\nIf you have a Mac, be aware if you have an Apple Silicon (M1 or M2) Mac or an Intel Mac. Many of the installations you will go through in this exercise have different versions for each processor type, and the program may not work properly if you still the wrong version. There’s nothing that can’t be undone, but it’s easier to be install the correct version first!\n\n\n\n\nInstall Julia\nI recommend installing Julia using the juliaup tool, which will let you easily manage versions in the future and works seamlessly with VS Code. The instructions can be found at the JuliaUp GitHub repository, but we will summarize them here.\n\nInstalling Juliaup on Windows\nIf your computer uses Windows, you can install Juliaup from the Windows Store.\n\n\nInstalling Juliaup on MacOS\nIf you have a Mac, open a terminal (such as the Terminal app) and enter:\ncurl -fsSL https://install.julialang.org | sh\n\n\nInstalling Julia 1.8.5\nOnce you install Juliaup, install Julia version 1.8.5 by opening a terminal (in MacOS or Linux) or the command line (in Windows) and entering:\njulia add 1.8.5\njulia default 1.8.5\nThis will install Julia 1.8.5 and make it the default version, which should maximize package compatibility throughout this course. Going forward, if you want to add new versions or change the default, you can follow the Juliaup instructions.\n\n\n\nInstall and Set Up VS Code\nYou can skip this section if you already have a coding environment you like; just set it up to work with Julia. Otherwise, VS Code is as close to an officially supported editor for Julia as you can get. We will follow this guide for setting up VS Code with Julia.\n\nInstalling VS Code\nYou can download it here; open the downloaded file to install.\n\n\nInstall the Julia Extension\n\nOpen VS Code.\nSelect View and click Extensions to open the Extension View. This view can also be found on the sidebar with the following logo:\n.\nSearch for julia in the search box. Click the green install button.\nRestart VS Code once the installation is complete. It should automatically find your Julia installation; talk to Vivek if not.\n\nThe Julia VS Code extension offers you some nice features. You can start a REPL (an interactive Julia coding environment) by opening the “Command Palette” (View -&gt; Command Palette, or CTRL/CMD+SHIFT+P) and typing “REPL” to bring up “Julia: Start REPL”. You can also create *.jl files to write Julia code and execute line by line. However, we will primarily use Jupyter notebooks in this class, but this might be useful for testing code or for your project.\n\n\nInstall the Jupyter Notebook Extension\nThe Jupyter Notebook extension allows you to export a Jupyter notebook to PDF or to HTML and then to PDF.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPDF Export for Gradescope\n\n\n\nYou will need to export every notebook to a PDF for submission to Gradescope. Direct export to PDF requires a LaTeX installation. If you would like to go this route, please look at the LaTeX installation instructions for your operating system.\nOtherwise, exporting to HTML and then using your browser to save the resulting page to a PDF is a perfect solution.\n\n\nFollow the same instructions as above, but search for jupyter and install the Jupyter extension. Restart VS Code.\n\n\n\nSet Up GitHub\n\nCreate GitHub Account\nIf you already have a GitHub account, you can use that for this course and do not need to create a new account.\nOtherwise, create an account. It doesn’t have to be linked to your Cornell email or use your Cornell NetID.\nFor labs and homework assignments (we will work on Lab 1 in class on Friday and Homework 1 is available), you should use the GitHub Classroom link to “accept” the assignment provided on Ed Discussion, which will give you your own GitHub repository for that assignment. The first time you click one of these links, you will need to link your place on the course roster with your GitHub account.\nWhen application exercises require notebook use (which is the case here, but will not always be), you can follow the workflow in these next steps, and will be prompted to do so in the instructions for that exercise.\nYou can do almost everything that you will need to do for this course with GitHub directly through VS Code, or you can use the GitHub UI or the Terminal. We will assume in these instructions that you will just work through VS Code."

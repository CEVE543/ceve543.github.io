# Extreme values

## Objectives

- Likelihood of extreme events
- Extrapolate
- Univariate (for now)

## Applications

Engineering design

- Streamflow
- Precipitation rates or totals
- Wind speed

## Extremes are rare

# Definitions

## Threshold models

## Block maxima

# Classical approaches

## Plotting position

## Plotting paper

## Log Pearson Type III distribution

## Method of moments

## $L$ Moments

# Modern methods

## GEV

## GPD

## MLE

## MAP

## Sampling

# Challenges

## Parametric Uncertainty

## Model Uncertainty

## Sampling Uncertainty

## Nonstationarity

# Wrapup

## Harvey and Addicks / Barker

I was asked to calculate what would happen under some specific assumptions (no suggestion of unbiasedness!)

::: {.callout-information}
- These were plausible assumptions, not necessarily the "right" or "best" assumptions (other side had many reasonable objections!)
- Large differences between estimates made under different assumptions underscore the challenge of "objective" esimates
- A hard problem (interacting drivers of nonstationarity, short records, etc)

## Means with missing values {.scrollable}

Let's say you have an array with some missing values, and you want to take the mean across a particular dimension.
How can you do this?


```{julia}
X = convert(Array{Union{Float64,Missing},3}, rand(11, 10, 9))

K = 10
X[shuffle(1:length(X))[1:K]] .= missing
```

We'd like to do this, but we'll get msising values

```{julia}
X_mean = mean(X, dims=3)
sum(ismissing.(X_mean))
```

Instead, we can do:

```{julia}
X_mean = [
    mean(skipmissing(X[i, j, :])) for i in axes(X, 1), j in axes(X, 2)
]
@assert size(X_mean) == (11, 10)
```

## How to use quotes

A system is:

::: {.quote}
> "an interconnected set of elements that is coherently organized in a way that achieves something...
>
> A system must consist of three kinds of things: *elements*, *interconnections* and *a function or purpose*."

::: {.cite}

## How to show things incrementally

For example:

::: {.incremental}
- Mass balance equations let us track changes in stocks at particular points;
- Equilibrium conditions are requirements that there is no net flow, and thus that stocks are preserved;
- Fate and transport modeling involves quantifying how stocks change as they move through the system.

## How to use columns

:::: {.columns}

::: {.column width=60%}
One example of an emergent systems dynamic is a **reinforcing (positive) feedback loop**, where a shock to the system state gets worse.

Feedback loops can also be **dampening (negative)**, where a shock is weakened.

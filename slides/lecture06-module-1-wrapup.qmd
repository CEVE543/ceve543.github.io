# Reflections

## Exam 1

- Average: 47.5
- Standard deviation: 15.9
- Maximum: 70
- Median: 49.5
- Easiest: maximum likelihood
- Hardest: computation, conditional probability 

## How I'll support your learning

- Reorganized schedule -- two modules not three
- Practice problems at start of class
- More links to suggested reading for each lecture

## Recommended reading

- [ThinkBayes](https://allendowney.github.io/ThinkBayes2/): simple and conceptual online textbook on Bayesian statistics
- [Rethinking Statistics](https://xcelab.net/rm/statistical-rethinking/): a more serious text on Bayesian thinking and estimation
    - Code examples on the website, including implementations in Turing
- [An Introduction to Statistical Learning](https://www.statlearning.com/): a machine learning perspective
    - Code examples in R and Python

There are many other resources available online; use them critically.

## How you need to support your learning {.smaller}

- Come to office hours
- Review lecture notes
    - Don't just read
    - Work through examples
    - Understand *why*
    - Ask questions

I have encouraged you to use tools (Copilot, GPT, etc) to help you with *computing syntax* so you can spend more time on *understanding concepts*.

# Revisions

## Revisions

- Exam I is graded
- Final grades will be curved, not each exam
- Revisions will be allowed

## Due Date

- Friday, October 6th at 11:00AM.
- Hand in to me in class
    - Legible and clear handwritten work OR
    - Type up your work[^gpt]
    - Hand in your original exam with your revisions

[^gpt]: If you type, disable tools such as GitHub Copilot

## Academic integrity

- Subject to Rice Honor Code
- DO: consult class notes, textbooks, linked resources, or write your own code
- DO NOT: Consult with a classmate, search the internet, usie AI chat tools, or otherwise collaborate is not permitted
- Ask if you're not sure

If you have questions about what is permitted, please ask. 

## Instructions

For each problem:

1. State how many points you earned on the original exam.
2. Derive the correct answer. Your answer should be **clearly written** and easy to follow.
3. Explain why your original answer was incorrect and what confused you (no revisions are needed if your original answer was correct!)

## Grading

1. On each problem, you will earn up to 60% of the points you missed
    1. Grading on the revision will be more strict than on the original exam
1. Additional 10% for clear and insightful explanation of your original mistake (where applicable)
1. T/F questions: up to 50% for a clear and correct explanation of **why** the statement is true or false
1. If your revision is worse than the original, your score will not be lowered.

## Suggestions {.smaller .scrollable}

::: {.incremental}
- Precipitation:
    - CDF: $F(x) = P(X \leq x)$
    - Can assume that $F(0)=0.6$
- Conditional probability: think hard about how to define $A$ and $B$
- Return period: read the wording carefully ("according to the distribution shown...", "...true return period")
- Recording of review session

## Bayes Rule

A doctor is called to see a sick child.
The doctor has prior information that 90% of sick children in that neighborhood have the flu, while the other 10% are sick with measles.
Assume for simplicity that there are no other illnesses and that no children have both the flu and measles.

A well-known symptom of measles is a rash.
The probability of having a rash if one has measles is 0.95.
However, occasionally children with flu also develop rash, and the probability of having a rash if one has flu is 0.08.
Upon examining the child, the doctor finds a rash.
What is the probability that the child has measles?

## Analytic posterior

We collect some count data and model it using a Poisson likelihood.
The Poisson likelihood is given by:
$$
p(y_i | \lambda) = \frac{\lambda^{y_i} e^{-\lambda}}{y_i!}
$$
where $y_i$ is the number of counts and $\lambda$ is the rate parameter of the Poisson distribution.
We want to do inference on $\lambda$.
We have a prior belief that $\lambda$ is distributed as an Exponential distribution with the modified parameterization:
$$
p(\lambda | \theta) = \frac{1}{\theta} e^{-\frac{\lambda}{\theta}}
$$
After collecting data $y_1, y_2, \ldots, y_n$, what is the posterior distribution of $\lambda$ given our prior parameter $\theta$?## Next week:

# Bayes Rule and Priors

## Rare Disease

The likelihood is not the posterior!

::: {.incremental}

- Everyone is tested for CEVE543acitis, a rare and deadly disease
- It is known that 1 in 100,000 people have CEVE543acitis
- The test is 99% accurate
- Your test comes back positive
- Maximum likelihood principle: a positive test is more consistent with having the disease than not!
- Using Bayes' rule, you probably don't have the disease (but always talk to your doctor)

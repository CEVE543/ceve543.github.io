# Climate Risk

## Floods in Paraguay, 2015

## TX Cold Snap, 2021

## How do we manage climate risks?


::: {.incremental}
- Reduce emissions to prevent future climate change (mitigation)
- Real-time monitoring and forecasting (early warning)
- Building codes and design standards
- Insurance
- ...
:::

## Decision analysis for climate risk management

Bayesian decision theory: maximize expected reward $R$ *(equivalently utility, loss, etc.)* for taking some decision $a$:
$$
\mathbb{E}(R(a)) = \int_{\mathcal{S}} R(a, {\bf{s}}) p({\bf{s}}) d{\bf{s}}
$$
Notably: 
$$
\mathbb{E}(R(a)) \neq R(a, \mathbb{E}(\bf{s}))
$$

## Our aim

::: {.incremental}
- In CEVE 521, we assumed that some imperfect estimates for $p(\bf{s})$ were available and studied principled ways to evaluate decisions
- In this class, we will estimate $p(\bf{s})$ from data
- "All models are wrong, some are useful": developing useful models requires understanding the model and how it will be used
- Communicating limitations / uncertainties is essential
:::

## Climate Hazard Assessment

- Often, we care about *extremes* (low-probability, high-impact events)
- 

## Characteristics of Environmental Data

What makes environmental data unique?

::: {.incremental}
- Spatial and temporal structure
- Non-stationarity
- Missing data
:::

## Chareacteristics of Climate Models

# CEVE 543

## Syllabus

[Syllabus](../syllabus.html){target=_blank}

## Lectures

::: {.incremental}
- Tests will cover material from lectures and labs
    - Slides will be posted ahead of time on course website (see [instructions](https://quarto.org/docs/presentations/revealjs/presenting.html#print-to-pdf){target=_blank} for printing to PDF)
    - Lecture will be recorded via Zoom and available on Canvas
- Occasionally, readings will be assigned ahead of time
- I am not a mind reader! Ask questions.
:::

## Labs

::: {.incremental}
- Most weeks, usually on Fridays (sometimes I will not be here, but Yuchen will be)
- Build your hands-on computational skills
- Apply conecpts from lectures to *simple* problems
- Graded on a 3 point scale
- Due one week after the in-class lab; solutions will be posted and discussed so no late submissions (turn in what you have)
:::

## Tests

::: {.incremental}
- Cover material from class and lab
- Always a review session
- There is a range of backgrounds in this class. Tests should be straightforward for those who meet pre-requisites.
:::

## Projects

::: {.incremental}
- Apply concepts from class and lab to a more complex and open-ended problem
- Each module will be motivated by a problem
- Each project will solve the problem
- If you have expertise in particular topics or methods, you can leverage it

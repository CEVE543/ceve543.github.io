- Good to get a sense of background and goals
- Invite students to share -- this will help me get a sense of how forthcoming they are

## What other climate hazards do you know about?

> Take a moment to think, write it down, and then we'll share.

## How do we manage climate risks?

::: {.incremental}
- Reduce emissions to prevent future climate change ("mitigation")
- Real-time monitoring and forecasting
- Building codes and design standards
- Insurance
- and much more!
:::

## Bayesian Decision Theory

Expected reward $R$ *(equivalently utility, loss, etc.)* for taking some decision $a \in \mathcal{A}$:
$$
\mathbb{E}(R(a)) = \int_{\mathcal{S}} R(a, {\bf{s}}) p({\bf{s}}) d{\bf{s}}
$$
**Crucial insight:**
$$
\mathbb{E}(R(a)) \neq R(a, \mathbb{E}(\bf{s}))
$$

## Implications

::: {.incremental}
- We often care about **extremes**
- Uncertainty (especially of extremes) matters
- What makes a "good" estimates of $p(\bf{s})$?
    - Physically accurate / realistic
    - High spatial and temporal resolution to quantify impacts on people and infrastructure
    - Large ensemble sizes to quantify uncertainty
    - Multiple scenarios (of "deep" uncertainties)

# Course Organziaton

## Syllabus

[Syllabus](../syllabus.html){target=_blank}

## Lectures

- Tests will cover material from lectures and labs
    - Slides will be posted ahead of time on course website (see [instructions](https://quarto.org/docs/presentations/revealjs/presenting.html#print-to-pdf){target=_blank} for printing to PDF)
- Occasional readings (assigned ahead of time on Canvas)
- I am not a mind reader! Ask questions.

## Labs (10%)

- Build your hands-on computational skills
- Most weeks, generally Friday
- Apply conecpts from lectures to *simple* problems
- Graded on a 3 point scale
- Due one week after the in-class lab; solutions will be posted and discussed so *no late submissions* (turn in what you have)

## Tests (40%)

- Material from lecture, assigned readings, and labs
- Always a review session

## Projects (40%)

- Apply concepts from class and lab to a more complex and open-ended problem
- Each module (except intro) centers on a project

Three rainfall-focused projects planned:

1. Downscaling
1. Frequency analysis
1. Weather typing

## Participation (10%)

Some ways to participate include:

- Attending every class
- Asking questions in class
- Answering questions on Canvas
- Coming to office hours

We will co-grade your participation for every module

# Should you take this class?

## Job opportunities

Growing climate analytics opportunities in:

- Insurance
- Finance
- Agriculture
- Engineering

And more!
These require an understanding of climate, probability, statistics, coding, and communication.

## Pre-requistes: Linear Algebra

You need basic matrix notation and multiplication, but not much more.
Let 
$$
A = \left[ \begin{matrix} a & b \\ c & d \end{matrix} \right], \quad 
B = \left[ \begin{matrix} e & f \\ g & h \end{matrix} \right], \quad 
x = \left[ \begin{matrix} k \\ \ell \end{matrix} \right], \quad 
$$

You should be able to (with note-checking as needed!) figure out:

:::: {.columns}
::: {.column width=50%}
- $A_{2,1}$
- $A + B$
- $AB$
:::
::: {.column width=50%}
- $A x$
- $x^T x$
- $x x^T$
:::
::::

## Pre-requisites: Probability and Statistics

You should have a course in applied statistics.
You should be able to:

- Compute summary statistics of a sample
- Define joint, marginal, and conditional distributions
- Understand probability density functions, quantiles, and cumulative distribution functions
- Explain a few probability distributions and where they are appropriate
- Perform and interpret linear regressions

## Pre-requisites: Coding

We will use the Julia programming language.
I think you'll find it easy and fun to learn!

- No experience in Julia is expected
- Some prior experience coding (R, Python, Matlab, C, etc.) is suggested
- If you have no prior coding experience, you will need to put in extra effort to learn the basics

## Questions?

- Wednesday: "What drives uncertain climate hazard?"
- Friday: "Lab 01: Setting up Julia, GitHub, and Quarto"

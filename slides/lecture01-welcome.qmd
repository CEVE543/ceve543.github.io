## What other climate hazards do you know about?

> Take a moment to think, write it down, and then we'll share.

## How do we manage climate risks?

::: {.incremental}
- Reduce emissions to prevent future climate change (mitigation)
- Real-time monitoring and forecasting (early warning)
- Building codes and design standards
- Insurance
- and much more!
:::

## Bayesian Decision Theory

Expected reward $R$ *(equivalently utility, loss, etc.)* for taking some decision $a \in \mathcal{A}$:
$$
\mathbb{E}(R(a)) = \int_{\mathcal{S}} R(a, {\bf{s}}) p({\bf{s}}) d{\bf{s}}
$$
**Crucial insight:**
$$
\mathbb{E}(R(a)) \neq R(a, \mathbb{E}(\bf{s}))
$$

## Implications

::: {.incremental}
- We often care about **extremes**
- Uncertainty (especially of extremes) matters
- What makes a "good" estimates of $p(\bf{s})$?
    - Physically accurate / realistic
    - High spatial and temporal resolution to quantify impacts on people and infrastructure
    - Large ensemble sizes to quantify uncertainty
    - Multiple scenarios (of "deep" uncertainties)
:::

## What makes environmental data unique?

::: {.incremental}
- Varying on multiple time structures (daily, seasonal, ENSO, multidecadal, secular)
- Spatial structure ("high dimensional")
- Non-stationarity
- Skewed
- Missing data
- Lots of zeroes

# Course Organziaton

## Syllabus

[Syllabus](../syllabus.html){target=_blank}

## Lectures

::: {.incremental}
- Tests will cover material from lectures and labs
    - Slides will be posted ahead of time on course website (see [instructions](https://quarto.org/docs/presentations/revealjs/presenting.html#print-to-pdf){target=_blank} for printing to PDF)
    - Lecture will be recorded via Zoom and available on Canvas
- Occasionally, readings will be assigned ahead of time
- I am not a mind reader! Ask questions.
:::

## Labs

::: {.incremental}
- Most weeks, usually on Fridays (sometimes I will not be here, but Yuchen will be)
- Build your hands-on computational skills
- Apply conecpts from lectures to *simple* problems
- Graded on a 3 point scale
- Due one week after the in-class lab; solutions will be posted and discussed so no late submissions (turn in what you have)
:::

## Tests

::: {.incremental}
- Cover material from class and lab
- Always a review session
- There is a range of backgrounds in this class. Tests should be straightforward for those who meet pre-requisites.
:::

## Projects

::: {.incremental}
- Apply concepts from class and lab to a more complex and open-ended problem
- Each module will be motivated by a problem
- Each project will solve the problem
- If you have expertise in particular topics or methods, you can leverage it
:::

# Should you take this class?

## Job opportunities

Growing climate analytics opportunities in:

- Insurance
- Finance
- Agriculture
- Engineering

And more!
These require an understanding of climate, probability, statistics, coding, and communication.

## Pre-requistes: Linear Algebra

You need basic matrix notation, but not much more.
Let 
$$
A = \left[ \begin{matrix} a & b \\ c & d \end{matrix} \right], \quad 
B = \left[ \begin{matrix} e & f \\ g & h \end{matrix} \right], \quad 
x = \left[ \begin{matrix} k \\ \ell \end{matrix} \right], \quad 
$$

Can you (with note-checking as needed!) figure out:

:::: {.columns}
::: {.column width=50%}
- $A_{2,1}$
- $A + B$
- $AB$
:::
::: {.column width=50%}
- $A x$
- $x^T x$
- $x x^T$
:::

## Pre-requisites: Probability and Statistics

You should have a course in applied statistics.
You should be able to:

- Compute summary statistics of a sample
- Understand probability density functions, quantiles, and cumulative distribution functions
- Define joint, marginal, and conditional distributions
- Explain a few probability distributions and where they are appropriate
- Perform and interpret linear regressions

## Pre-requisites: Coding

We will use the Julia programming language (lab 01).
I think you'll find it easy and fun to learn!

- No experience in Julia is expected
- Some prior experience coding (R, Python, Matlab, C, etc.) is suggested
- If you have no prior coding experience, you will need to put in extra effort to learn the basics

# How to lab

## Overview

Labs are in-class exercises intended to get practice with coding or analysis workflows.

- Instructions available on website
- Download ahead of time by using link from Canvas
- You will have your own repository (more in a minute)
- Try to finish in class, but due in 1 week

## Tool overview

In this class, we will use

::: {.incremental}
1. Julia
1. GitHub
1. Quarto
1. VS Code (suggested)
:::

## Why Julia?

::::: {.incremental}
:::: {.columns}

::: {.column width=50%}
- Syntax
    - Readable to computers and humans
    - Closely parallels math notation
- Designed for numerical and scientific computing
:::

::: {.column width=50%}
- Fast! 
    - "Two language problem"
    - All you need is Julia
- Open source

## Julia example

A (naive) implementation of the Fibonacci sequence:

```{julia}
#| echo: true
function fib(n)
    if n < 2
        return n
    else
        return fib(n - 1) + fib(n - 2)
    end
end
fib(10)
```

## GitHub

::: {.incremental}
1. You need a GitHub account
1. Code is stored in "repositories"
1. `clone` a repository to your computer
1. Make changes and `commit` them
1. `push` your changes to GitHub
1. Using GitHub classroom, instructors can view your code
:::

## Quarto

Quarto is a tool that allows you to combine text and code and create many types of output

- This website is made with Quarto
- You will use Quarto to create reports for labs
    - Everything in one place
    - No running code, save a figure to `Downloads`, copy into Word, then update your code and try to remember where to paste it
- Reproducible

## VS Code

1. VS Code is a text editor
    1. If you are an advanced user of another text editor, you can use that instead, but I recommend VS Code
1. VS Code can work as a Julia IDE

# Getting set up

## Detailed instructions

See [Setup](/setup.html){target="_blank"}

## Lab 01 Instructions

1. Install software up following [instructions](/setup.html){target="_blank"} on course website
1. `clone` the repository for lab 01 (use the Github Classroom link from Canvas)
1. Edit the `solutions.qmd` file to add your name and netID
1. `commit` and `push` your changes

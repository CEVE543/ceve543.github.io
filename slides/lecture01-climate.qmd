description: Climate hazards, such as floods, droughts, and tropical cyclones, are uncertain. In this lecture, we discuss the sources of uncertainty in climate hazards, and how we can quantify them.

# What questions will we answer?

::: {.notes}
Most of the exmaples I'll give are related to water or electricity, but they apply to other types of risks as well

## Sizing a stormwater pipe

::::: {.columns}
:::: {.column width="60%"}
::: {.incremental}
1. Rainfall-runoff model
    - e.g., peak flow from rational method: $Q = CiA$
    - $i$ is rainfall intensity, $A$ is area, and $C$ is runoff coefficient
1. Design rainfall based on *return period* $T$
    - $p(i > i^*) = 1/T$
1. Size your culvert to handle $Q^* = Ci^*A$
1. Requires knowing $p(i)$!

## Floodplain mapping in a riverine system

::::: {.columns}
:::: {.column width="60%"}
::: {.notes}
This is a moderately simplified workflow
:::

::: {.incremental}
1. Analyze historical streamflow data at a gauge
1. Take the 99th percentile (100 year *return level*) of *annual maximum* streamflows
1. Use a hydraulic model to model where the water goes

## Reservoir sizing (simplest version)

::: {.incremental}

1. Consider $N$ years of inflows (and releases, evaporation, etc)
1. Count number of times reservoir is empty ("failure")
1. Repeat experiment many different times with different inflows
1. **If** you are sampling this from $p(\text{inflow})$, you can estimate the reliability
    1. *Monte Carlo* method
    1. Why not just use observed inflows?
:::

## Index insurance pricing

::: {.incremental}

1. Index insurance: if some index $I$ is above a threshold $I^*$, pay out $X$
    - Total rainfall in a season, area flooded, etc
1. Let $p^* = p(I > I^*)$ is the probability of a payout
1. Naive pricing: $R = p^* X$
1. Risk premium: $R = X \left( \mathbb{E}[p^*] + \lambda \mathbb{V}^{1/2}[p^*] \right)$

:::

## Other examples

::: {.incremental}

1. Seasonal electricity resource adequacy [@doss-gollin_txtreme:2021]
1. Levee design [@garner_slrise:2018]
1. Water supply planning [@fletcher_mombasa2019]
1. Multihazard design [@bruneau_multihazard:2017]
1. etc...

## Important note

All of these workflows are slightly simplified, but communicate the main idea.
For each of these motivating problems, we need to know the probability distribution of some hazard -- $p(\bf{s})$ to use our notation from last class

## Problem statement:

> You are designing a storm surge barrier on Galveston Bay.
What is the probability distribution of storm surge at your location?

This knowledge will help you trade off the cost of the barrier against the residual risk of flooding.

## What do we need to know?

>  Take a moment, write, and then share

## Historical data

::: {.column width="50%"}

## Tropical cyclone tracks and characteristics

Can we use models to create a longer "synthetic" record?

![@bloemendaal_synthetictc:2020](../_assets/img/Bloemendaa-2020-fig1.png){width=100%}

## Wind and rainfall fields

If we're going to generate *synthetic storms*, we need to model the wind and rainfall fields (and other boundary conditions) in order to model the storm surge (using Adcirc, GeoClaw, SFINCS, etc)

## Sea level

:::
::: {.column width="50%"}
What separates the scenarios?
To first order:

1. How much $CO_2$ we emit
1. How much the climate system warms in response to $CO_2$ (*climate sensitivity*)
1. Ice sheet response to temperatures

:::
::::

## Limitations

@sobel_biases:2023:

> Models are incorrectly simulating the equatorial Pacific response to greenhouse gas warming. This implies that projections of regional tropical cyclone activity may be incorrect as well

## Lessons learned?

::: {.incremental}

- Historical data
    - Measures what we care about
    - Sampling uncertainty
    - Doesn't account for future conditions
- Model simulations
    - Can account for future conditions
    - May be biased or inaccurate
    - Model structure uncertainty

# Wrapping up

## Some terms to know ðŸ˜‰

- Return period
- Return level
- Monte Carlo
- Synthetic record
- Climate sensitivity

You should also be able to reason about the merits and limitations of different *methodologies* for estimating the probability distribution of a hazard (more practice incoming!)

## Questions?

Friday:

1. Bring your laptop, if you have one. 
1. Create an account at [https://github.com/](https://github.com/)

I will be absent on Friday (visiting Harris County Flood Control District).
Yuchen will lead [lab 01](../labs/lab01/instructions.html).

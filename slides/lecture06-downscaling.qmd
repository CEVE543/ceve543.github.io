# Downscaling

## We would like to accurately model precipitation at high spatial and temporal resolution

- Stormwater management (long-term desigm)
- Water resources management (subseasonal to multi-year planning)
- Fire propagation (hourly to weekly)

## Objectives

1. enhanced spatial detail
2. mitigation of systematic ESM[^ESM] biases
3. generation of variables not explicitly rendered by GCMs

## Challenges, summarized

::: {.incremental}
1. ESMs are tuned to get energy balance and large-scale circulation right, not local extremes
1. ESMs average over space and time
1. Local-scale precipitation can be tricky to model well

# Downscaling: theory

## Supervised downscaling

::: {.incremental}
- Input: pairs $(X_i, y_i)$
    - $X_i$: predictors (e.g., gridded rainfall)
    - $y_i$: predictand (e.g., gauge rainfall)
- Goal: learn a function $f$ such that $f(X_i) \approx y_i$
    - Measure quality of approximation through a *loss function* (more later)
- Key point: the $X_i$ and $y_i$ are observed at the same time
    - Example: map satellite to radar data
:::

## Distributional downscaling

::: {.incremental}
- ESMs simulate from the distribution of weather, given climate boundary conditions. For example:
    - Run 100 ESM *ensemble members* over 20th century conditions
    - Study December 1, 1980 in all draws
    - Some will be rainy, some will be dry; some cool, some warm
    - Statistically meaningful, but not a forecast!
- No pairs $(X_i, y_i)$. Instead we have samples $\left\{X_1, \ldots, X_N \right\}$ and $\left\{y_1, \ldots, y_K \right\}$
:::

## Common datasets {.smaller .scrollable}

::: {.incremental}
- Gauge data
- Gridded observational products
    - For example: radar measurments are processed to produce gridded rainfall estimates
- Reanalysis products
    - Use *assimilation* to "digest" observations using a model
    - Gridded reconstructions of past weather
    - State of the art is [ERA5](https://www.ecmwf.int/en/forecasts/dataset/ecmwf-reanalysis-v5)
- ESM outputs
    - Historical runs
    - CMIP: compare multiple models on standardized scenarios (e.g., RCP 2.6, 4.5, 8.5)
    - Simulate from weather, **conditional on boundary conditions** 
:::

## Bias correction

Simplest form of downscaling.
Usually $X$ are samples from a climate model and $y$ are observations.
$$
\begin{aligned}
\text{bias} &= \mathbb{E}[X] - \mathbb{E}[y] \\
\hat{y} &= X - \text{bias}
\end{aligned}
$$

Is this a distributional or supervised method?

## Stationarity

Stationarity means the relationship between $X$ and $y$ does not change over time

- Supervised: $p(y | X)$ or $y = f(X)$ does not change over time
- Distributional: Corrections to the distribution do not change over time

This is never a perfect assumption

# Project 1

## Your task

::: {.incremental}
- Given:
    1. Hourly gridded rainfall data (small area)
    1. Hourly large-scale pressure and temperature fields
    1. Hourly gauge rainfall data at a single station
- Develop a model to predict hourly gauge rainfall from the available datasets
:::

## Expectations

- Try and compare at least two different approaaches
- Quantitative and qualitative evaluation of the models
- You can use any methods you like:
    - Those we cover in class
    - Those you already know## References
